Dashcam footage shows motorists stopping to rescue the animal after spotting it lying abandoned on the dual carriageway in Pontypool, Wales.

The kitten was taken to a local vet for checks but did not suffer any injuries.

A witness told the RSPCA they saw the cat come out a car window on the roundabout between the A4043 and A472 on 30 June at around 4.23pm.

“We’re very grateful to those who managed to safely stop when this happened and help this poor kitten,” said inspector David Milborrow, who is investigating this incident.

“It was remarkable that this kitten survived this shocking incident without injury.

“We’re now appealing to any other drivers who may have seen this happen.”

Investigators believe the kitten may have come from a grey car, which was possibly a Fiat.

The footage also shows a red Mazda car that also stopped a few metres further down the road.

“We’d really like to speak to them to see what they witnessed,” said Inspector Milborrow.

The kitten is being looked after by a foster carer with charity Cats Protection in Gwent.

787577,theirishtimes--2019-06-20--Where simple curves become more complex than you think,2019-06-20,theirishtimes,Where ‘simple curves’ become more complex than you think,"The preoccupations of mathematicians can seem curious and strange to normal people. They sometimes expend great energy proving results that appear glaringly obvious. One such result is called the Jordan curve theorem. We all know that a circle has an inside and an outside, and that this property also holds for a much larger collection of closed curves.

A “simple closed curve” is a closed continuous loop in a plane that does not intersect itself. Such a distorted version of a circle is also called a Jordan curve, after the French mathematician Camille Jordan, who first proved some of its key properties.

The Jordan curve theorem states that every simple closed curve, no matter how complicated or convoluted, divides the plane into two regions, an inside and an outside. The theorem appears so trivial that it does not require a proof. But results such as this can be much more profound than a first glance might suggest and, on occasions, things that appear obvious can turn out to be false.

Bernard Bolzano, a Bohemian mathematician, philosopher and priest, was the first person to pose the curve problem in explicit form. He was convinced of the need to introduce rigour into mathematical analysis. He claimed that, for a closed loop in a plane, a line connecting a point enclosed by the loop (inside) to a point distant from it (outside) must intersect the loop. This seems obvious enough, but Bolzano realised that it was a non-trivial problem.

The first proof of the curve theorem appeared in Jordan’s influential book Cours d’analyse, first published in 1882. The theorem is easily stated and easy to prove for curves that are polygons, consisting of straight line segments.

However, for general curves it is quite difficult to prove since “simple” curves can have some bizarre properties, such as being jagged everywhere with no definite direction, or as being fractal in nature like the boundary of a snowflake. This makes it difficult to distinguish which points are inside and which are outside. The proof uses advanced ideas from the branch of mathematics known as topology.

The “travelling salesman problem”, or TSP, seeks the shortest route a salesman can choose to visit a number of cities and return to his starting point. The solution of this optimisation problem is a Jordan curve. Such curves have served as inspiration for artists.

Prof Robert Bosch of Oberlin College in Ohio uses results from optimisation theory to produce artistic images using these simple loops. The illustration shows a sculpture – Embrace – by Bosch, where a simple closed curve separates two regions, represented by metals of different colours. Bosch solved a TSP problem with 726 cities to form the boundary in this sculpture.

Intuition serves as an invaluable means of discovering new mathematics, but it can also lead us astray. There is always a need for rigour in proving seemingly-obvious results.

For Jordan curves, the great German mathematician Felix Klein expressed the problems thus: “Everyone knows what a curve is, until he has studied enough mathematics to become confused through the countless number of possible exceptions.”

Police have arrested three people in connection with the blaze but have not released their names or any details surrounding the crime.

The C.H. Cook Memorial Church is the oldest Presbyterian church in the state, and it went up in flames last Monday. Now, the community is trying to figure out what comes next.

Fox10 reports: The church was built in 1918, and it was located at Church Street and Pima. It was a historical pillar of the community, but now, three people are being charged with burning it down.

“Answering all the questions of why and how and what for, that’s the hard work,” said Rev. Munroe.

Officials with the Gila River Police Department say three people have been questioned and arrested for arson.

Their motives are not known, but Rev. Munroe says the historic C. H. Cook Memorial Presbyterian Church was a pillar in the community, having been built over one hundred years ago. The loss of the church is not only sad for worshipers but everyone in the small town.

“It wasn’t just Presbyterians gathered in the courtyard, watching the first responders put out the fire,” said Rev. Munroe. “It was members of the community. Members of the community would come by and say, ‘hey, I remember when I was 12 and I worshiped there. I remember doing Bible in the basement.'”

As of now, it’s still not safe to enter the burnt-out remains of the church to see if anything is salvageable. Rev. Munroe said they did have long-term goals to bring the church back to its former glory.

1068346,"upi--2019-12-05--Early climate change models were pretty accurate, study finds",2019-12-05,upi,"Early climate change models were pretty accurate, study finds","Dec. 5 (UPI) -- Early climate models get a bad wrap for being imprecise, but new research suggests they were surprisingly accurate.

Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and NASA reviewed 17 climate models described in scientific papers over the last several decades. The earliest were developed in the 1970s, while the most recent were created in late 2000s.

Of the 17 models, analysis showed 14 were very accurate in predicting the average global temperature in the years following their publication.

Scientists published their review this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

""The real message is that the warming we have experienced is pretty much exactly what climate models predicted it would be as much as 30 years ago,"" lead study author Zeke Hausfather, a doctoral student in UC Berkeley's Energy and Resources Group, said in a news release. ""This really gives us more confidence that today's models are getting things largely right as well.""

Scientists looked at each model's prediction for the Earth's average temperature based on greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and compared the predictions to actual global temperatures recorded at similar greenhouse gas levels.

In effect, the study's authors looked at how well models simulated the relationship between emissions and temperature increases, not at how well models predicted changes in global emissions.

""We did not focus on how well their crystal ball predicted future emissions of greenhouse gases, because that is a question for economists and energy modelers, not climate scientists,"" Hausfather said. ""It is impossible to know exactly what human emissions will be in the future. Physics we can understand, it is a deterministic system; future emissions depend on human systems, which are not necessarily deterministic.""

One of the first models to draw attention to the problem of global warming, developed by James Hansen of NASA in 1988, overestimated methane emissions and underestimated the impact of the Montreal Protocol treaty, which banned chlorofluorocarbons. As a result, the model predicted inflated temperature increases.

But when researchers accounted for these missteps and looked only at the model's understanding of the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature increases -- the physics of global warming -- they found Hansen's work was quite accurate.

""If you account for these and look at the relationship in his model between temperature and radiative forcing, which is CO2 and other greenhouse gases, he gets it pretty much dead on,"" Hausfather said. ""So the physics of his model was right. The relationship between how much CO2 there is in the atmosphere and how much warming you get, was right. He just got the future emissions wrong.""

When scientists plugged real-world greenhouse gas levels into most of the surveyed models, they spit out temperatures close to what weather stations actually recorded.

Climate models continue to improve, but the accuracy of most models is judged on their ability to predict -- or replicate -- past climate scenarios. The latest is one of the first to take a shorter look back to see how climate models predicted the future of global warming. The study's authors suggest their work can help climate modelers continue to improve their model's predictive powers.

""Climate models are a really important way for us to understand how the climate could change in the future, and now that we have taken a detailed look at how well past climate models have held up in terms of their projections, we are far more confident that our current generation of models are getting it right,"" Hausfather said.",,https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2019/12/05/Early-climate-change-models-were-pretty-accurate-study-finds/9171575560694/,"Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:20:31 -0500",1575580831,1575594767,environment,climate change
335615,naturalnews--2019-04-18--CDC says US birth rates are down death rates are up,2019-04-18,naturalnews,"CDC says U.S. birth rates are down, death rates are up","(Natural News) The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that U.S. birth rates were down in 2017 by more than two percent compared to 2016. The downward, depopulating trend has been observed in recent years. The CDC also said that death rates were up, with heart disease, stroke, and Alzheimer’s becoming all too common.

This is all good news for Bill Gates and other eugenics cheerleaders who openly call for depopulation efforts. In a 2010 TED presentation, Microsoft mogul Bill Gates talked about combating climate change by reducing the world’s population. Gates, who spends hundreds of millions of dollars on vaccine development and deployment, argues that: “The world today has 6.8 billion people… that’s headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.”

He presented a formula for reducing CO2 emissions: CO2 = People x Services per person x Energy per service x CO2 per energy unit. In order to get CO2 to zero, Gates said, “probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty close to zero.” Since the adoption of Bill Gates’ Common Core curriculum in public schools, textbooks have indoctrinated the next generation about the “problem of overpopulation.”

Some of the world’s richest and most powerful people believe that human population should be controlled at a level desirable to them (much like China’s one child policy.) Since then, the world has also witnessed the discovery of vaccines laced with sterilization chemicals, targeting African children.

100% organic essential oil sets now available for your home and personal care, including Rosemary, Oregano, Eucalyptus, Tea Tree, Clary Sage and more, all 100% organic and laboratory tested for safety. A multitude of uses, from stress reduction to topical first aid. See the complete listing here, and help support this news site.

The CDC said deaths from “age-related” diseases are on the rise, even though conditions such as Alzheimer’s aren’t necessarily age-related. Alzheimer’s has been linked to the accumulation of heavy metals (such as the aluminum found in vaccines) passing through the blood and blood-brain barrier to destroy memory processes. In a cause and effect world, age isn’t a contributing factor to disease. Bad habits established over time cause chronic disease, but time alone doesn’t cause pain, suffering, and decimated cellular health.

Unfortunately, America doesn’t have the best healthcare system in the world. The increasing rate of disease came at a time when Americans were paying the most they ever had for healthcare. There are rarely any results — only a diseased, dying population. This is because true healthcare starts at the cellular level of the individual, with one’s relationship to the soil, its healthy microbes and minerals being most important. How can a population thrive if it is disconnected from the plants that spring forth from the ground, the plants that provide all the vitamins, enzymes, prebiotics, healthy fats, and antioxidants required for healthy development and a fulfilling quality of life?

Birth rates have fallen steadily since 2007 and were at their highest in 1990. Currently, the birth rate is 59.2 per 1,000 women. As Bill Gates said, reproductive health services (birth control pills) are slowing conception rates. Not to mention, there are now more endocrine disrupting chemicals in the environment than ever before, disrupting human hormones that govern human fertility. Atrazine and BPA are two examples of chemicals that compromise human fertility.  More men and women are infertile because of the amount of chemicals their bodies are exposed to, lowering sperm count and restricting their ability to assimilate nutrients needed for healthy reproduction. Sexual behaviors that discourage reproduction and gender change surgeries have become increasing glorified and promoted, also contributing to lower birth rates. Along with this, young adults are spending lots of time online, going to college longer, living off their parent’s dime longer, and are afraid to mature and start a family of their own.",Lance D Johnson,http://www.naturalnews.com/2019-04-18-cdc-says-u-s-birth-rates-are-down-death-rates-are-up.html,2019-04-18 02:45:49+00:00,1555569949,1567542557,society,demographics
4908,activistpost--2019-07-02--Americas Concealed Crisis Fifty Years of Economic Decline 1969 to 2019,2019-07-02,activistpost,"America’s Concealed Crisis: Fifty Years of Economic Decline, 1969 to 2019","If we consider the long term, it’s clear America’s economy and society have been declining for the average household for 50 years.

What if the “prosperity” of the past 50 years is mostly a statistical mirage for the bottom 80% of households? What if whatever real gains (adjusted for real-world loss of purchasing power) accrued only to the top of the wealth-power pyramid, those closest to financial and political power? What if the U.S. economy and society shifted from “everybody wins” to “winner takes all” or at best, “winner take most”?

These are not “what if”, they’re reality. The working class, which as I have recently noted, now comprises the entire working populace other than the upper-middle class Misplaced Pride: Most of the “Middle Class” Is Actually Working Class (June 14, 2019), has lost ground over the past 50 years, from 1969 to the present.

The keys to understanding the concealed crisis of decline are purchasing power relative to wages/earnings–how many goods and services can wages buy? For the average American household, wages have risen modestly while the purchasing power of those wages has plummeted.

Furthermore, the quality of goods and services has in many cases declined sharply, so that even if prices have dropped, what you get for your money has fallen even further, effectively reducing the purchasing power of your wages.

Case in point: appliances were once designed and built to last a generation or longer. Refrigerators, washers and dryers lasted for decades. Now the average appliance fails within a few years, and the electronic board–costing roughly a third of the entire appliance price–fails and must be replaced. With labor, the cost of the repair is so high, consumers often send the almost-new appliance to the landfill and buy a new (and soon to fail) appliance.

Net-net, low quality reduces purchasing power even if price has declined.

Then there’s the big-ticket items: rent, housing, college, healthcare. Anecdotally, I’ve been told a young engineer in Silicon Valley could earn $20,000 a year and rent a modest apartment for $200. Now the young engineer makes $100,000 but rent for the modest flat is $2,500 per month: wages rose five-fold but rent rose 12-fold.

This is a staggering loss of purchasing power.

As for college, tens of millions of students completed their university training with zero debt–student loan debt as we understand it today simply didn’t exist because it was unnecessary.

The scarcity value of that college diploma has fallen precipitously over the decades, rendering most degrees that aren’t part of artificial scarcity schemes essentially valueless.

As for healthcare: we now have $100,000 operations that work miracles on one side and people being bankrupted by costs on the other, and tens of thousands dying of opioid drugs promoted by the status quo as “safe” and non-addictive. Where metabolic disorders (lifestyle diseases such as diabesity) were once a relative rarity, now up to a third of the entire population is at risk of chronic lifestyle diseases that are difficult and costly to manage–but oh so profitable to those delivering the meds and care.

Bottom line: how much housing, higher education and well-being does the average wage buy now compared to decades past? Not much. The statistics are bleak: wages are basically unchanged from the high water mark 50 years ago, which coincidentally was also the high water mark of U.S. energy production until very recently. Adjusted for purchasing power and quality, the average paycheck buys far less than it did 50 years ago.

Wages’ share of the national income has plummeted since the last secular expansion of wages in the Internet boom of the late 1990s.

The average household’s ownership of productive capital, and thus of financial security, has declined. There’s fewer assets within reach and those that are in reach have been reduced to a casino of booms and busts that wipes out all but the most agile gamblers.

If we consider the long term (la longue duree), it’s clear America’s economy and society have been declining for the average household for 50 years. Nobody wants to admit this because it’s politically inconvenient, to say the least. What do we make of a society in which only the top 5% have prospered in terms of their earnings buying more goods and services?

Meanwhile, everyone else has compensated for the sharp decline in purchasing power by going ever deeper into debt while the nation has decayed into a landfill economy.",Activist Post,https://www.activistpost.com/2019/07/americas-concealed-crisis-fifty-years-of-economic-decline-1969-to-2019.html,2019-07-02 00:58:17+00:00,1562043497,1567537149,"economy, business and finance",economic sector

Paws & Claws asked 1,000 British and Irish dog owners what they do with their pets during the day when they are out at work.

We discovered that although the average dog is left home alone for six hours a day, owners treat them to little luxuries to make up for it.

More than two-thirds of dog owners (69 per cent) feel guilty about leaving their pet “home alone” for more than five hours at a time.

One in ten feel guilty leaving their dog at home on its own for just an hour at a time.

Our survey found that 65 per cent of owners leave the heating on to make sure their dog is comfortable in the house.

And 53 per cent say they leave a light on for their pets while they are out of the house at night.

Forty-eight per cent leave the radio on to give their pooch some company while a dedicated one in four (25 per cent) leave the television on so their pampered pup has some stimulating entertainment.

Bizarrely, 15 per cent of owners also believe their dog has a favourite telly show.



Mark Hackett of supersaveroil.com, which conducted the survey on our behalf, said: “It’s lovely to see how much people care about their animals.

“I expect there are some cases where the animals are actually receiving more luxuries than the owners themselves — especially when it comes to the heating, as this is something people can be notoriously stingy about.

“I love the notion that dogs might have favourite TV shows.

“Some of these pets are absolutely living their best lives.”

Dennis Allison is 78 years old and lives in Redcar, North Yorks.

After his border collie sadly died, Dennis writes: “I’m not as active as I once was, so I don’t think another collie is a good idea. But I do want a pet. I’m thinking of a cat.”

Sean says: “Sorry to hear you’ve lost your lovely dog. Collies are fantastic and intelligent but sometimes hard work to keep occupied, especially when they are young.

“A good rehoming centre might be able to match you with a lovely older dog with more suitable energy levels than a puppy.

“Older cats are also a good choice, as they often find it hard to get homes once they end up in shelters or rescue centres through no fault of their own.”

Sophie Thatcher, who is six and from Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, adores her gerbil Gerry.

She says: “Gerry is a little piglet that chews through everything. I give him lots of snacks and seeds but whenever he’s out of his cage, he chews the sofa and the carpet. I got him at Christmas and he’s always chewed. Mum wants to get rid of him.”

Sean says: “Here’s the bad news: Rodents chew and gerbils are no exception. It’s part of their natural behaviour.

“They’re also highly social animals, so keeping one on its own isn’t great and may lead to frustration, which might mean Gerry chews more than normal.

“The best way to keep gerbils is in single-sex pairs, in a glass tank that has as large a space as possible, with lots of deep bedding and tunnels to burrow through. For some great ideas, look up ‘gerbilariums’ online.

“If you do let Gerry out, ‘free-range’ isn’t the safest option for him or for your furniture. So maybe think about a safe penned-off area with solid sides and plenty of toys and tunnels for him to explore.”",Sean Gallen,https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/9693849/watching-tv-secret-life-your-pets/,2019-08-10 21:45:49+00:00,1565487949,1567534458,human interest,animal

With the advent of instant video sharing, we’ve seen hundreds, perhaps thousands of cases of unidentified flying objects. Scientists and governments have discounted the vast majority of these instances as meteors, asteroids, man-made rocket tests or weather balloons.

But on October 19, 2017, a Canadian astronomer saw an anomaly floating through our solar system that can’t be so easily dismissed.

The object, dubbed “Oumuamua,” is the first ever object detected by humans that originated outside of our own solar system. Moreover, what makes Oumuamua even more intriguing is that as it rounded the sun it accelerated in such a way that our known laws of physics simply can’t explain it.

That is, unless the object has its own propulsion system, which would in turn suggest that it is not naturally occurring, but rather, deliberately built by an advanced civilization.

The claim sounds like an Ancient Aliens conspiracy theory, until you realize that the scientists behind the theory is none other than Avi Loeb, Chairman of Harvard University’s Astronomy department and founding director of The Black Hole Initiative. And while most scientists would never risk their careers over wild and outlandish claims, Loeb says he has enough tenure to not be concerned about it. That and he believes his analysis is accurate.

According to Loeb, the acceleration data sourced from the Hubble Space telescope is indicative of an object that has been, “deliberately sent to the inner solar system,” and he believes it could be a reconnaissance spaceship.

What does it feel like to sit next to colleagues in a university lunchroom a day after publishing an article arguing that Oumuamua may actually be a reconnaissance spaceship? Loeb: “The article I published was written, in part, on the basis of conversations I had with colleagues whom I respect scientifically. Scientists of senior status said themselves that this object was peculiar but were apprehensive about making their thoughts public. I don’t understand that. After all, academic tenure is intended to give scientists the freedom to take risks without having to worry about their jobs. Unfortunately, most scientists achieve tenure – and go on tending to their image.” “It was only under consecutive observation for six days, from October 25 to 31 – namely, a week after its discovery. At first they said, Okay, it’s a comet – but no comet tail was visible. Comets are made of ice, which evaporates as the comet approaches the sun. But we didn’t see a trail of gas or dust in Oumuamua. So the thinking was that it must be an asteroid – simply a chunk of stone. But the object rotated on its axis for eight hours, and during that time its brightness changed by a factor of 10, whereas the brightness of all the asteroids that we’re familiar with changes, at most, by a factor of three. If we assume that the light reflection is constant, that means its length is at least 10 times greater than its thickness.” The biggest surprise came last June, when new data from the Hubble Space Telescope showed that the mysterious object had accelerated during its visit to the inner solar system in 2017 – an acceleration that is not explained by the sun’s force of gravity. We have no way of knowing whether it’s active technology, or a spaceship that is no longer operative and is continuing to float in space. But if Oumuamua was created together with a whole population of similar objects that were launched randomly, the fact that we discovered it means that its creators launched a quadrillion probes like it to every star in the Milky Way. Of course, the randomness is significantly reduced if we assume that Oumuamua was a reconnaissance mission that was deliberately sent to the inner solar system – namely, to the habitable region where life would be feasible. But we need to remember that humanity didn’t broadcast anything tens of thousands of years ago, when the object was still in interstellar space. They didn’t know there was intelligent life here. Which is why I think it’s just a fishing expedition.” Full Interview Via Haaertz: If True, This Could Be One of the Greatest Discoveries in Human History

The object Oumuamua is long gone and we may never know what it really was.

What we do know is that we’ve seen similar cigar-shaped objects appear in the skies over Earth throughout history.

On April 14, 1561 the town of Nuremberg, Germany was abuzz with contemporary news reports highlighting a celestial phenomenon directly overhead. According to witnesses, there was some sort of aerial battle involving various types of alien aircraft.

The event was documented in local newspapers:

Here is a brief description of the events of the day translated from the news report above:

These all started to fight among themselves, so that the globes, which were first in the sun, flew out to the ones standing on both sides, thereafter, the globes standing outside the sun, in the small and large rods, flew into the sun. Besides the globes flew back and forth among themselves and fought vehemently with each other for over an hour. And when the conflict in and again out of the sun was most intense, they became fatigued to such an extent that they all, as said above, fell from the sun down upon the earth ‘as if they all burned’ and they then wasted away on the earth with immense smoke. After all this there was something like a black spear, very long and thick, sighted; the shaft pointed to the east, the point pointed west. Whatever such signs mean, God alone knows.

While hard to believe, consider the shape of the object identified in October of 2017 and compare it to the images above.

If nothing else, it’s curiously coincidental.

Another example of a cigar-shaped or rod-type object was observed as recently as 2010, when it shut down a Chinese airport. The incident was actually reported on by ABC News:

The origins of these objects may never be known, but more evidence of the existence of an advanced alien species begins to emerge. Some have even suggested that governments around the world may be actively working with them and utilizing advanced technologies.

For now, it’s all very hush-hush. but perhaps one day the people of the world will witness direct contact with an alien species not of this planet.",Mac Slavo,https://www.dcclothesline.com/2019/01/14/shock-claim-chairman-of-harvard-astronomy-says-oumuamua-object-is-reconnaissance-spaceship-deliberately-sent-to-the-inner-solar-system/,2019-01-14 16:14:04+00:00,1547500444,1567552631,science and technology,natural science

760608,theindependent--2019-05-28--aposBurn-outapos recognised as chronic condition by World Health Organisation,2019-05-28,theindependent,&apos;Burn-out&apos; recognised as chronic condition by World Health Organisation,"Burn-out is a phrase you might’ve heard banded around over the years to describe feeling physically and emotionally run down.

While some could’ve been tempted to dismiss burn-out as millennial jargon, it has now been added to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) International Classification of Diseases, meaning that it will become a globally-recognised medical condition as of 2020.

The WHO defines burn-out as “chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed”.

It characterises the condition with the following symptoms: feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job; and reduced professional efficacy.

The WHO only refers to such feelings within work environments and clarifies that burn-out should not be applied to describe symptoms caused by other life situations.

A spokesperson for the WHO told Agence Presse France on Monday that it’s the “first time” burnout has been classified as a medical condition by any official health body.

The phrase “burn-out syndrome” is credited to German-born psychologist Herbert Freudenberger, who used the term in a 1974 study of the condition.

Freudenberger analysed the phenomenon after he observed it in some of his colleagues, who described themselves as being “burnt out” and later also experienced it himself.

The psychologist described the state of being burnt out as “becoming exhausted by making excessive demands on energy, strength, or resources”.

In January 2019, a Buzzfeed article titled How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation went viral. Writer Anne Helen Peterson was praised for accurately describing how and why the condition is impacting people aged 18 to 34 and in some cases rendering them emotionally and physically paralysed.

However, unlike the WHO, Peterson recognises burn-out in areas outside of the workplace, writing: “Burnout and the behaviours and weight that accompany it aren’t, in fact, something we can cure by going on vacation.

“It’s not limited to workers in acutely high-stress environments. And it’s not a temporary affliction: It’s the millennial condition. It’s our base temperature. It’s our background music. It’s the way things are. It’s our lives.”",Olivia Petter,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/burnout-world-health-organisation-medical-condition-chronic-stress-a8932806.html,2019-05-28 09:26:00+00:00,1559049960,1567539974,health,health organisations
292533,"liveaction--2019-12-09--As declining fertility rates are a growing problem worldwide, Hungary takes an innovative approach",2019-12-09,liveaction,"As declining fertility rates are a growing problem worldwide, Hungary takes an innovative approach","Government officials and pro-family advocates from Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and the United States met earlier this week in Washington, D.C., for the 2nd International Conference on Family Policy. Poland and Brazil were represented for the first time. They addressed the stark reality that over half of the world’s population — citizens of the United States along with every single European Union member country included — live in countries with below-replacement level fertility rates.

Rather than counting on mass immigration to offset fertility rates below 2.1 children per woman as many countries have, Hungary shared a different approach. Among the incentives introduced since Prime Minister Viktor Orban took office in 2010 are loans up to $35,000 for parents to cover costs of living like mortgage payments. Furthermore, having three or more children can qualify families for complete forgiveness of the loan. According to the Christian Post, other benefits include ” a state-funded day care system, three years of paid parental leave, free kindergarten, and subsidized vacations.” What’s more, starting in 2020, mothers of four or more children will no longer have to pay income taxes. Hungary furthermore prioritizes preborn babies and nuclear families headed by one father and one mother. Enacted in 2011, Hungary’s Constitution reads “embryonic and fetal life shall be subject to protection from the moment of conception.” The Constitution also upholds “the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman established by voluntary decision, and the family as the basis of the nation’s survival.”

Hungary’s Ambassador to the U.S., Laszlo Szabo, explained the rationale behind all of these initiatives. “We believe that strong family policy makes the country stronger and the nation stronger. When we are talking about nations, we are not talking about The Washington Post version of nationalism. We are talking about loving your country and making your country more successful.” Of note, both abortion and divorce rates have decreased in Hungary during the nine years since Prime Minister Orban took office.

Joe Grogan, Director of the Trump administration’s Domestic Policy Council, celebrated Hungary’s efforts, and emphasized pro-family steps that the U.S. has taken since 2016. He cited President Trump’s doubling of the child tax credit to $2,000 for American families, efforts to decrease unnecessary regulations on child care providers, and bipartisan promotion of paid family leave as evidence of America’s commitment to promoting strong families. Grogan also stressed President Trump’s commitment to the sanctity of preborn human life, noting that “he has restricted the use of fetal tissue for federally funded research, and published a regulation that prevents the mixing of taxpayer funding for Title X family planning program with projects that promote or refer for abortion as a method of family planning.”

Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland also dismissed the myth of overpopulation, saying “There is a growing realization among western nations that there have been myths propagated over the years. The myth, for instance, that overpopulation is the result of a birth rate. It’s not true. I am a physician. These graphs that present overpopulation is not because we have too many births, it is that people have now stay healthier and live longer because we deliver better medical care.”

Forecasters have issued weather alerts for Wales, northwest England and western Scotland, where deluges were expected on Friday.

This wet weather is set to continue into the weekend, with downpours also possible on Sunday.

Yellow weather warnings for rain are in place across most of Wales and parts of northwest England until 6pm on Friday. A similar alert for western Scotland is in place until 3pm.

Flooding of “a few homes and business” is likely while roads could become waterlogged, causing delays for drivers, the warnings state. Trains could also be affected.

Downpours are likely to ease on Saturday but “it will still be a wet, grey, rainy day,” particularly in the southern half of the UK, said Met Office spokesman Ollie Claydon.

“There’s a band of rain that is fairly persistent and is still going to be a feature by Sunday,” he told The Independent.

He added: “That’s right across the south coast and up to south Wales and a little bit further into the Midlands.

“It’s also going to be quite windy, especially in the northwest and the southwest.”

Further bands of rain are set to move in later in the weekend, with “only the far north of Scotland holding on to any sort of brightness,” Mr Clayton said.

The Met Office added “autumnal, unsettled weather” would continue into next week, with further showers and longer spells of rain in many parts of the country. It is also forecast to be windy, “with a chance of coastal gales at times”.",Chris Baynes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-weather-forecast-latest-met-office-yellow-warnings-rain-weekend-a9151711.html,"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 08:43:49 GMT",1570797829,1570803045,weather,weather forecast
404250,pamelagellerreport--2019-10-16--British Museum exhibit explores the influence of Muslim culture on the West,2019-10-16,pamelagellerreport,British Museum exhibit explores the influence of Muslim culture on the West,"Does this exhibit explain how the Islamic influence on Western art was severely limited by the fact that Sharia forbids representation of the human form? Or would that reflect negatively upon Islam and Sharia, and so is forbidden to be stated? Will the British Museum host an exhibition on how Western art influenced the Islamic world, a topic about which there is a great deal that could be said, ranging from the cultural appropriation of Byzantine church architecture to the stylistic similarities of Shi’ite iconography to Western art? The answer to both questions is “of course not.” This is just another example of the British intelligentsia’s ongoing efforts to compel Britons to be ashamed of their own culture and heritage, and to think of Islamic culture as antecedent and superior to their own. It’s just more of Britain’s ongoing cultural suicide.

“Exploring the influence of Muslim culture on the West,” by Gavin O’Toole, Al Jazeera, October 13, 2019:

London, United Kingdom – A 19th-century painting of a harem by European artist Antoine-Ignace Melling has been animated, subverting the depictions of the women within, from passive subjects of erotic fantasy to drab creatures engaged in jerky, repetitive movements reminiscent of a cuckoo clock.

This is contemporary Turkish artist Inci Eviner’s reimagining of a “classic” portrayal of an Ottoman harem and its message is serious. Art from the Middle East is outgrowing its “Orientalist” straitjacket.

Her work is part of a major exhibition in London’s British Museum called Inspired by the East, that explores the significant – yet often unacknowledged – influence of Eastern culture on the West.

“Discover centuries of art inspired by the Islamic world,” the museum promises visitors.

Co-curator Julia Tugwell said there has been a resurgence of interest in Orientalist work after it fell out of fashion for years, and she hopes the exhibition can help to reduce barriers thrown up by politics.

“People might forget that there has been an exchange between East and West for centuries, much longer than we think and while, of course, some of that has been warfare, a lot of it has been diplomatic relations and artistic exchange.

“Looking at this through an artistic medium and showing how there has been this interest in the ‘other’ from both directions over the years shows that there has been an ongoing dialogue.”

Organised in collaboration with the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia, the exhibition traces Western fascination with the Eastern and Muslim world since the medieval era….

Catherine Futter of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, who contributed to the exhibition’s catalogue, said Islamic influence in European design endures.

“We still see Islamic arches and patterns incorporated into architecture and perhaps we see them so often they seem part of our currency and we have forgotten their sources – whereas in the 19th century they would have seemed far more unusual.

“One of the things that is exciting about this exhibition is that it is highlighting that important contribution to art, culture, science and technology made by the Islamic world.”…

Egyptian-British artist Iythar, who lives in London, said the exhibition could not have come at a better time amid rising anti-Muslim sentiment.

“This is very important and should have been done sooner because it helps people see the positive impact Islam has had in the world – not just in art but culture in general.

“Many people only choose to listen to what they hear in the media and don’t know anything about Islam, so when they go to an exhibition like this and appreciate the benefits of the Islamic culture, it fosters tolerance.”",Pamela Geller,https://gellerreport.com/2019/10/british-museum-exhibit-explores-the-influence-of-muslim-culture-on-the-west.html/,"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 14:00:28 +0000",1571248828,1571264007,"arts, culture, entertainment and media",culture
23262,bbc--2019-02-20--Samsung unveils foldable smartphone,2019-02-20,bbc,Samsung unveils foldable smartphone,"Samsung has unveiled a foldable smartphone - the Galaxy Fold - alongside a 5G Galaxy S10 handset and three other Galaxy S10 mobiles.

The Fold will go on sale in just over two months time, earlier than many expected.

The Galaxy S10 5G features the firm's biggest-ever non-folding phone display and promises faster data speeds when networks become available.

The S10 line-up also includes the introduction of a lower-cost model.

Samsung had previously acknowledged that the cost of its S9 range had contributed to ""lower-than-expected sales"".

Samsung said the Galaxy Fold would open up to create a 7.3in (18.5cm) tablet-like display and would be able to run up to three apps at once.

A demo showed off ""app continuity"" features by which the device transferred from one mode to another much more smoothly than had been the case with an earlier foldable phone - Royole's FlexPai.

One example involved a Google Maps screen appearing on the Fold's smaller front display and then expanding to a larger view when the handset was opened following a one-second pause.

Samsung added that Whatsapp, Facebook, YouTube and Microsoft Office would also be optimised to suit the new form-factor.

It said that it had designed a new type of hidden hinge system that would withstand hundreds of thousands of folds and unfolds, and contained a battery on each side to extend its runtime.

In addition, the South Korean firm said the phone contained six cameras - three on the back, two on the inside and one on the front - to ensure it could take photos however it is held.

A 4G version of the Galaxy Fold is set to go on sale on April 26 and will start at $1,980 (£1,515). A more expensive 5G edition was also promised.

Samsung described it as being a ""luxury"" item.

""Fold is an experience that gives people who want a phone but also a larger screen with no compromise on the phone experience,"" commented Carolina Milanesi from the consultancy Creative Strategies.

""There's a lot of tech packed in there. And it makes sense to have kept it under $2,000 even if only for the psychological effect that has.""

But another market watcher still had doubts.

""In theory, foldables are hugely attractive: they pack a giant screen into a small design,"" commented Neil Mawston from the research firm Strategy Analytics.

""But in reality, consumers don't know exactly how they will work, and the applications for them are still fairly immature.

""You can look back at history at the dual-screen folder phones that ZTE and NEC and others release. They haven't sold particularly well mostly due to price and lack of distribution.

""So, there's good potential, but still a lot of uncertainty.""

In the short demonstration we saw today, Samsung's use case of watching entertainment, playing games and app multi-tasking will make a lot of sense for a lot of people. This is a tremendously creative feat of engineering. Folding screens seem like a good idea.

What won't work, however, is the price. I've been at many launch events like this, and normally the worst case scenario for the firms putting on the show is a lack of applause when the price is announced. Today we saw something worse - loud grumbles, even some laughter. $1,980? Simply too much.

Also, I wonder about some other aspects of this phone we can't judge yet as we haven't had a chance to hold it. When Samsung's head of mobile placed it into his suit pocket on stage, it landed with all the grace of a cartoon anvil.

So: possibly heavy, with two likely-hot batteries, and a huge price tag.

Creative, sure? Practical? For me, Samsung has fallen short - but the effort should excite gadget fans who have been longing for something different for so long. I suspect this device will have people flocking to stores to see it up close, if not to actually purchase it.

The S10 series is likely to remain Samsung's focus when it comes to sales for the foreseeable future.

The S10 and S10+ will cost more than the phones they supersede - beginning at £799 and £899 respectively when they go on sale on 8 March.

But the S10e means the Galaxy S range now starts at a lower price-point - £669 - albeit with lower specifications to match.

The S10 5G is yet to be priced and only has a vague ""summer"" release planned.

""Having a 5G variant is strategically important for Samsung as it gives them the jump on Apple and helps maintain the firm's brand strength and perceived technology leadership,"" commented Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy.

""It also gives the operators a tier-one brand for their 5G launches.

""But as far as consumers are concerned, unless you have a very good reason to buy a 5G phone this summer, one of the other three S10 handsets is probably a better investment, and will be viable for use for many years.""

The launch comes days before Mobile World Congress in Barcelona - a trade event where Samsung's rivals will unveil new handsets of their own.

The overall smartphone market shrank in 2018, but Samsung's sales saw a particularly pronounced drop-off as Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers wooed away customers.

All four versions of the S10 are distinguished from last year's models by embedding the front cameras within their displays.

Samsung refers to this as being the Infinity O design, but it is more commonly referred to as the ""hole punch"".

The move allows the phones to feature a thinner top bezel without having the kind of ""notch"" found on many rivals.

It has, however, caused the firm to ditch the eye iris-scanner introduced in the S8.

Samsung says a new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor placed under the screens of the three higher-end phones offers close to the same level of security, and is more convenient to use than a scanner formerly placed on phone backs.

It is based on a technology unveiled by Qualcomm in 2015.

All versions of the handset feature wireless charging and introduce the ability to wirelessly charge other compatible devices in turn.

This mirrors a feature first offered by Huawei's Mate 20.

Samsung demoed the facility at a dual London and San Francisco launch as a way to recharge a new pair of Bluetooth headphones without having to use a separate cable or power mat.

All four devices now feature a 10 megapixel selfie camera and introduce a 16MP ""ultra-wide"" rear version, which offers a slightly larger field-of-view than our eyes.

The S10+ also has a second selfie camera to help it take depth readings.

In addition, the S10+ and S10 5G now offer up to one terabyte of internal storage, which the firm says could appeal to those shooting lots of 4K video or storing many game files.

""What's positive is that Samsung has moved away from software that nobody wants - like AR emojis and Samsung Cloud - and has gone back to its roots to deliver market-leading hardware,"" commented Ben Stanton, from market analysis firm Canalys.

""So for the premium part of the market, these are good phones.

""But my concern is that [they are still] not innovative enough to stop people from looking down to lower-price bands and being drawn into mid-range products from Chinese companies that are super-competitive.""

The introduction of a lower price tier may help address this.

But trade-offs for picking the S10e include:

By contrast, the S10 5G benefits from several exclusive features:

""The phone had to be larger to feature a bigger battery because 5G [data transfers] will drain it much faster,"" commented Mr Stanton.

""But it was also smart to offer a large screen.

""The use cases for 5G aren't yet defined, but one potential is to stream 4K video rather than HD. And having a bigger screen makes that more compelling.""

The original S-series handset was released days ahead of Apple's iPhone 4, and had a bigger 4in screen and microSD card slot in its favour.

At that point, its main Android rival was the HTC Desire, and although Samsung's device was lighter, thinner, and had a more powerful graphics processor, some reviewers said it felt less ""premium"" in the hand than its competitor.

The second-generation device saw its display grow to 4.3in, its rear camera increase in resolution to 8MP, and its processor move over to a dual-core design.

It was praised for allowing owners to unlock it by pressing the home key, rather than having to press a button on top as before. And although some griped that it still felt plasticky, it sold in its millions - helping Samsung overtake Nokia as the world's bestselling mobile phone-maker.

The third-generation model established a trend of including a bigger display but compensating for the growth by shrinking the size of the bezels.

Its innovations included the ability to detect when the screen was being looked at, so as to avoid dimming the image. And it introduced S Voice, allowing users to command music to play and photos to be taken by speaking to it.

Samsung added further touchless controls to the S4, letting owners scroll through text by making eye movements, and accept calls with a hand wave.

A dual-camera feature also created photos that blended together the views from the front and rear lenses.

Some critics found this all to be a bit gimmicky, and although the handset was a hit, there were reports that its sales fell short of Samsung's expectations.

The S5 added a fingerprint scanner, which could be used to authenticate purchases via PayPal.

It also introduced a black-and-white mode to help save battery life. But predictions that the firm would ditch Android for its in-house operating system Tizen proved to be inaccurate.

The S-series split in two in 2015 with a premium-priced Edge version offering a screen that curved round one of its sides.

A metal frame and glass back gave the handsets a more luxury feel, but they ditched water resistance and a microSD slot to make this possible.

The seventh-generation phones looked pretty similar to their predecessors, but restored the ability to dunk them in water and slot in extra storage.

Other improvements centred on the camera with better low-light and autofocus capabilities.

The S8 and larger S8+ ditched the home button, took Samsung's logo off the front and added the virtual assistant Bixby.

They also gained an iris scanner, which was billed as ""one of the safest ways"" to keep data private.

After scandals involving exploding Note 7s and the arrest of the firm's vice-chairman, the launch helped return the firm to surer footing.

The S9 and S9+ gained new camera features including a super-slow-motion video mode and a variable aperture - allowing owners to control how much light reached the sensor.

AR emojis also allowed users to create animated cartoon characters that looked like them.

But sales were lacklustre, and several months after it was unveiled Samsung acknowledged there had been ""resistance"" to its price.

Cameras that poke out of the screen and four distinct models mark out the latest generation.

But there are signs Samsung's smartphone dominance is slipping...",,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47277324,2019-02-20 20:13:58+00:00,1550711638,1567547894,science and technology,technology and engineering

UK election meddling accusations spread from Russia, to India... to Hillary","If you believe the daily reports, Britain's ongoing election campaign is facing more interference than an old analogue television during a rainstorm, and amazingly, it's not just Russians being accused of being behind it.A sense of old world grandeur is easily inflated by convincing yourself that you're so important that the whole world wants to swing your election.Representing the old US of A this morning on the BBC was one Hillary Rodham Clinton. I know she isn't an official representative of Washington, but I'm not sure she does, so her input is significant, especially as the old glutton for punishment has been hinting she might take another tilt at the White House.But first to those Indians. It's been recently reported that a UK support group for the BJP, India's ruling Hindu nationalist party, has been campaigning for the Conservative party in 48 marginal seats. It's also claimed that Whatsapp messages have been sent to Hindus in Britain suggesting they shouldn't vote for ""anti-India"" Labour.The Guardian went to speak to a community of Hindus, the majority of which rejected the idea that they would let outside forces influence their vote. One Labour MP has been quoted as saying Hindus would never be swayed by this kind of outside interference.It would be remiss not to finish with the latest allegation against Russia, and here it is. No sooner had the Labour party announced that it had suffered a cyber attack on its online operations than those trusty old unnamed sources were wheeled out in the media to throw accusations in Moscow's direction.This will be confusing to a lot of people who were under the impression that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was a fully paid up Russian stooge, which would make his party a strange target for Moscow.

26393,bbc--2019-04-28--Should these school clubs be kept secret from parents,2019-04-28,bbc,Should these school clubs be kept secret from parents?,"Should parents be told if their children are members of gay-straight alliances - student-run peer support groups for LGBT students and allies in their school? In one Canadian province, that question has sparked fierce debate.

Gay-straight alliances - or GSAs - were first established in the US in the 1980s.

The student-run clubs are meant to be a place where LGBT and other students can socialise and offer peer support. Research on GSAs suggests they create a ""safe space"" for students at a greater risk of mental health issues and discrimination, and can reduce bullying and harassment in schools where they're established.

Some 30 years after the first one was founded by a history teacher and a student at Concord Academy in Massachusetts in 1988, thousands of GSAs exist in middle and high schools across North America.

Despite their proliferation, these peer support groups have also faced resistance.

One protracted battle over GSAs has been playing out in the Canadian province of Alberta - an issue debated in the provincial legislature, in the courts, and in the media.

The latest flare up began during the recent provincial election in the province.

At issue was a policy proposed by United Conservative Party (UCP) leader Jason Kenney to undo some legal protections for the school clubs, notably one that bars school officials from telling parents if their child has joined such a group.

Critics of Kenney's plan say school staff could ""out"" LGBT students to parents who might not be supportive of, or might even be discriminatory of, their sexuality or gender identity - with potentially damaging consequence.

Kenney - whose UCP swept the election and who will soon be premier - argues his proposal is a compromise between supporting GSAs and respecting parental authority.

In his election night victory speech, he said that ""parents know better than politicians what is best for their kids"".

Alberta is not the only place GSAs have caused social friction.

In the United States, where the federal Equal Access Act guarantees that public school students have a right to form GSAs, the American Civil Liberties Union says the groups have prevailed in at least 17 federal lawsuits under the act between 1998 and 2015.

Most of the US lawsuits were over obstacles put in place by school officials opposed to the clubs, like making last minute changes to school rules to prevent a GSA from being established.

Concerns about the activities in GSAs has also cropped up in the US, with one California student battling his school telling the BBC in 2000: ""This whole thing has stopped being about my club. It's become this debate about sex"".

Albertan Dylan Chevalier, executive director of Sexual and Gender Acceptance Edmonton, says GSAs are about ""having a place where you can be safe, relax, and take your walls down for half an hour"".

Chevalier was the president of a GSA at his former high school, and he said the club hosted discussions and pizza parties, held bake sales to fund LGBT awareness campaigns and once organised a ""drag and dance show"".

Local skirmishes over the clubs have also been seen in the UK and in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, which also protect a student's right to start a GSA.

University of Calgary's Darren Lund, who teaches social justice education, says that the issue has always had ""the potential to be polarising"".

He says there's been a rapid cultural shift towards a greater acceptance of LGBT issues in the last 15 years or so - one that makes some people feel ""discomfort"".

""And then politicians are quick to jump on that fear and use that fear to play into people's insecurities about these issues,"" he says.

In 2014, legislation was first proposed to require all the province's public schools to establish a GSA on the request of a student.

The right-leaning provincial government at the time eventually passed a law - Bill 10 - establishing that protection. It received support from all the provincial political parties.

Some cheered the move, but it also led to protests.

Advocates argued the law didn't do enough to protect LGBT students. Others called it an infringement on freedom of religion and parental rights.

In 2015, the left-leaning NDP swept to power in Alberta and added more protections for GSAs.

It passed Bill 24, which required schools, both public and private, to have a policy in place to allow for it to comply ""immediately"" with a student's GSA request.

Further, school officials would not be allowed to disclose a student's involvement such a club.

""No students will be outed for joining a GSA or a QSA [queer-straight alliance] in the province - it's against the law,"" the provincial education minister said at the time.

Schools were put on notice - if they don't follow the law they risk having accreditation and funding stripped.

Lindsay Peace, who has a son who is transgender and who is an advocate for trans youth in the province, has been a vocal supporter of protecting GSAs.

""I think it's important for kids to know that they belong,"" she says ""And sometimes it's the only place [where they do].""

And as for parents who want to know what their children are up to at school: ""they should ask them"", she says.

In Alberta, the second GSA law was contentious from the get-go.

""This legislation would create a void of care for our children, into which anyone can set up shop, without proper oversight or accountability,"" one parents rights group stated in an op-ed.

The Calgary-based Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms (JCCF) filed a court challenge on behalf of a coalition of parents and 26 faith-based independent schools, arguing bills 10 and 24 breach multiple constitutional rights, including by failing to protect a parent's right to educate based on his or her own conscience and religious beliefs.

It says the law further ""undermines parental rights by prohibiting parents from knowing if their child is being exposed to sexual content through a GSA"".

Court documents filed by the legal group warn that ""the parents are alarmed and frightened at the climate of secrecy that the School Act has created around ideological sexual clubs and related activities"".

JCCF president John Carpay summed up the tension up way: ""The fuss is about making these clubs mandatory in schools where the parents disagree completely with the perspective or the belief system that is being advocated by these clubs"".

""It's the difference between voluntary versus coercive.""

Kenney's proposed policy - to roll back some GSA protections but to keep Bill 10 in place - looks unlikely to satisfy either side.

Says Chevalier: ""He's playing a game. He's pandering to the social conservative side of his base and playing a fast one [with everyone else].""

The JCCF is waiting for a court decision on whether an interim injunction it's seeking on Bill 24 will be granted.

Carpay told the BBC he's uncertain whether the schools his organisation represents will want to continue with the court challenge and fight the 2015 GSA protections that would remain in place if Kenney's government does roll back Bill 24.

Meanwhile, campaigners like Peace and Chevalier say they'll continue to fight for GSA protections in all Alberta schools.

Peace says she thinks it's students themselves who will end up creating more inclusive schools, regardless of how fierce the GSA fight might get between parents and politicians.

Calgary high school students are now organising a province-wide school walkout next month - a few days after Kenney is to take office - to protest his party's GSA plans.",,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47901707,2019-04-28 23:44:46+00:00,1556509486,1567541808,education,social learning

Meese, 87, is now widely thought of as a leader of the Reagan-era conservative movement. But he also left the administration in the face of ethical concerns. He was accused of ""blindness to the abuse of the position"" as attorney general in a report authored by former Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.

During the ceremony, Mr. Trump spoke about Meese's long list of roles in state and federal civil service. At one point, the president joked that Meese's contentious and lengthy confirmation process to be attorney general sounded like ""what we go through,"" referring to his own administration.

After receiving the award, Meese thanked all of those in attendance and congratulated Attorney General William Barr for the work he is doing.

In a statement issued by the Heritage Foundation, where he is a fellow emeritus, Meese said he's grateful for the opportunity.

""I am greatly honored to receive such recognition from President Trump,"" Meese said in a statement. ""For many years, I had the privilege of serving the country under President Ronald Reagan. During that time and throughout my life and career, my aim has been to remain committed to the Constitution, the rule of law and the conservative American values that have made America 'the shining city upon a hill.'""

University of Liverpool student Ceara Thacker, 19, was found dead in her room in the Brownlow Hill accommodation on May 11 last year.

The five-day inquest at the Gerard Majella Courthouse in Liverpool heard her family was not informed she had taken an overdose three months before her death, or that she was struggling with her mental health.

Speaking outside the court on Friday, her father, Iain Thacker, 56, said: ""For as long as I live I will never understand why no-one at the university picked up the phone to us in February 2018, and told us that our 19-year-old daughter was in hospital after taking an overdose.

""If we had known how Ceara was suffering we could have, and would have, made a difference.""

He said his daughter, from Bradford, had found herself ""falling through the cracks"" with different mental health services, who failed to communicate with each other.

He added: ""In my view it is absolutely essential that all universities have in place proper systems for identifying students at risk and communicating effectively with healthcare services and, where appropriate, with families, to ensure they are kept safe.""

Her mother Lorraine Dalton-Thacker, 51, said: ""At every turn, she was failed.

""I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for her. She should not have had to face this and it breaks our hearts that she did.

""We don't want any other family to go through this pain.""

Recording a conclusion of suicide, area coroner Anita Bhardwaj said she would make a report for the prevention of future deaths to the NHS, recommending that the issue of parental involvement, with consent, was included in mental health assessments.

She said: ""It's difficult and unclear whether Ceara would have had a different outcome had she had additional mental health appointments, been given an urgent appointment, and had family involvement.""

Ms Bhardwaj said there was no record of discussions between medical professionals and Miss Thacker about contacting her family.

She said: ""It would have been helpful to have those discussion, so if Ceara wanted additional support from her family that could have been facilitated.

The coroner described a delay of two months between Miss Thacker referring herself to the university's mental health advisers in February, and being given an appointment in April, as ""unacceptable"".

The court heard the delay was caused by ""exceptional circumstances"", including strike action, staff sickness and training days.

Mr Thacker said it was ""disappointing"" that the University of Liverpool had chosen not to adopt an ""opt-in process"", which is now used at Bristol University, where students fill in a form when registering to ask whether they would want their parents to be contacted in the event of mental health problems.

Gavin Brown, pro-vice-chancellor for education at the University of Liverpool, said: ""We have conducted a thorough review of the support Ceara was offered and, as a result of this and our ongoing review of how these services work, we have instigated a number of improvements to mental health support services.

""This includes an additional £0.5 million investment in staffing and the introduction of rapid access appointments with an adviser.

""Following Ceara's death, we have also updated guidance to ensure that students who are experiencing substantial distress as a result of mental health difficulties are asked whether they would like to inform family members.

""We know that students' family circumstances can differ, and where students choose not to inform family we will explore reasons for this, and work with individuals to identify alternative support networks.""",newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (James Rodger),https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/student-found-hanged-university-halls-16956651,2019-09-20 17:23:21+00:00,1569014601,1569590552,education,parent organisation

The Met Office has issued weather warnings for snow showers, strong winds and icy conditions for much of the UK.

While the cold weather will be noticeable to most, the snow is not expected to accumulate, the Met Office said

Dan Suri, the Met Office’s chief meteorologist, said: “From Thursday colder Arctic air will have spread across the country, with temperatures struggling to reach above 5C [41F] or 6C for most of us. This is close to the average January temperature for the UK, but since it has been quite a mild winter so far, many will notice the difference by the end of the week.

“It’s going to feel very cold overnight with temperatures widely dipping close to or below freezing.”

The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings across much of the UK. There could be ice on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths, putting people at risk of slips and falls, and some commuters could experience longer journey times on the roads, and on buses and trains. Drivers have been told to take care travelling over the hills and in northern coastal areas.

Colder air will move across the UK on Wednesday followed by even colder air arriving from the Arctic on Thursday.

Widespread frost and icy stretches are expected from Wednesday night and will continue into the weekend, the Met Office said. Scotland, parts of the north, and eastern England could also see snow showers.

The drop in temperatures does not mean the return of the “beast from the east”, which brought heavy snowfall last year.

Marco Petagna, a Met Office meteorologist, said: “It has been so mild this winter that it will be a bit of a shock to the system even though temperatures will be average for this time of year or just below.”

Dr Emer O’Connell from Public Health England said: “Experience shows us that every winter thousands of people are seriously affected and even die from illnesses linked to the cold.”

She added: “All of us should be heating our homes to at least 18C, keeping up to date with weather forecasts and planning our days around them – simple steps can really help protect against the cold.”",Aamna Mohdin,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/16/uk-weather-snow-ice-warnings-cold-snap-forecast-met-office,2019-01-16 11:05:16+00:00,1547654716,1567552245,weather,weather forecast
2154,abcnews--2019-11-12--Navajo leader: Tribe won't back energy company's new mines,2019-11-12,abcnews,Navajo leader: Tribe won't back energy company's new mines,"The Navajo Nation will not financially back bonds a tribal energy company needs for a trio of newly acquired coal mines off the reservation, the tribal president said Tuesday, explaining that it's too risky and his administration wants the company to move away from coal.

The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. recently bought Montana's largest coal mine and two mines in Wyoming at auction after Cloud Peak Energy declared bankruptcy.

The mines can keep operating for now because more than $370 million in reclamation bonds posted by Cloud Peak remain in place, state officials said.

Tribal President Jonathan Nez said he canceled agreements the energy company might have relied on to seek the Navajo Nation's financial backing for the bonds. He said the company wasn't forthcoming about information related to acquiring and operating the mines, and he wants to protect the tribe's finances as revenues decline from the loss of a coal plant and mine on the reservation. Tribal lawmakers had been considering legislation to do the same thing.

""The Navajo Nation's financial portfolio as well as our resources would be placed in a state of uncertainty if we allowed NTEC to proceed with finalizing the bonds needed to operate these three mines using the (Navajo) Nation's consent ..."" Nez wrote in a statement.

The development marks the latest turmoil to hit the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, the nation's largest coal-producing region, where bankruptcies and declining demand have put a pall over a once-vibrant industry. Hundreds of people in the region were put out of work for months after another bankrupt company, Blackjewel, drastically scaled back operations at two of the biggest coal mines in the U.S.

The tribal energy company was created in 2013 to buy a coal mine in New Mexico on the reservation. It also owns a 7 percent stake in the nearby Four Corners Power Plant. While it was organized under the tribal government, it operates somewhat independently.

Nez said the legal documents creating the company gave the tribe's executive branch unilateral authority to administer what are known as general indemnity agreements. He said the bonds in place for the Navajo Mine and the Four Corners power plant won't be affected by his decision.

The energy company has said terminating the indemnity agreements could have serious impacts on the company's operations and increase the costs to secure reclamation and other bonds. It urged tribal lawmakers last week to seek other solutions to support bonds for the Cloud Peak purchases.

""NTEC has always considered these acquisitions to be highly advantageous and profitable,"" company spokesman Erny Zah wrote Tuesday in response to questions from The Associated Press. ""While we understand the president's decision with regard to the indemnity agreements, we continue to see very successful operations and prospects ahead.""

The Cloud Peak deal made the Navajo company the third-largest coal producer in the U.S. The deal covers Wyoming's Antelope and Cordero Rojo mines and Montana's Spring Creek mine. About 1,200 people are employed at the mines, which combined produced almost 50 million tons of coal last year.

Antelope is the third-largest coal mine in the U.S., while Spring Creek ranks eighth and Cordero Rojo is 11th.

Lining up bonds on its own could be a challenge for the tribal energy company, given the state of the coal industry, said Joe Aldina, a coal industry analyst at the research firm S&P Global Platts.

A succession of coal company bankruptcies already put state regulators on ""high alert"" to make sure companies have the financial wherewithal to conduct cleanups, he said. Also, a decade-long wave of coal-fired power plant retirements has decreased demand for the inexpensive but heavily polluting fuel, which could make financial firms hesitant to get involved with reclamation bonds.

""Bonding companies are going to be more skeptical,"" Aldina said. ""They are going to require more collateral or higher interest rates or they're just not going to extend these surety guarantees.""

State regulators are unlikely to release the Cloud Peak bonds until the mines' new operator can come up with bonds on its own. That means taxpayers in Montana and Wyoming won't be left on the hook for future reclamation or cleanup costs.

""They can operate like this as long as they like, because Cloud Peak has the permit,"" said Keith Guille with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. ""We cannot review the permit until they show they have bonds in place.""

At Spring Creek, NTEC has indicated it will cover for now the fees needed to maintain the existing $109 million reclamation bond that was in place when it bought Cloud Peak's assets, said Montana Department of Environmental Quality spokeswoman Rebecca Harbage.

Those fees amount to about 1% of the bond total, or about $1 million annually, Harbage said.

Lochlan Murdoch, 10, will trek the equivalent of more than a marathon as he laps around the likes of Celtic Park and Ibrox – as well as Hampden Park and Cumnock’s Townhead Park.

The young striker, who has type 1 diabetes, is raising money for the Kris Boyd Charity and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).

He said: “The fundraising idea I have had is to do a stadium marathon, which will cover two miles at 14 grounds.

“I have type 1 diabetes and was diagnosed five-and-a-half years ago so this is why I really want to raise funds for JDRF Scotland.

“They do lots of work and research for people like me and hopefully one day they will find a cure for type 1.

“Also in May 2018, I suffered a really bad leg break whilst playing football for Cumnock Juniors 2008s.

“I had to have an operation to fix it and was in a cast and then a leg brace for four months.

“I became very sad and felt left out and really alone. I lost my confidence because I couldn’t play football.

“I stopped going to watch training and games because I felt so sad at not being able to take part and play with my friends.

“Once I told my mum how I was feeling, she got me some help and I’m starting to feel a bit better.

“This is why I have chosen The Kris Boyd Charity as I know it is important to tell someone how you are feeling.”

Lochlan added: “I decided I wanted to challenge myself and get myself back to being fit 

 and healthy and to reach a new goal.

“Football is my favourite thing in the world and Kilmarnock are my team.

“I train with Kilmarnock’s development team too and when I am older I want to play professional football like Jamie MacDonald and Kris.

“I don’t want type 1 or being sad to stop me from achieving everything I want to achieve.”

Sue and Noel Radford have announced they are expecting a girl - meaning they will have 11 girls and 11 boys.

Sue, 44, told The Sun she can't wait to give birth again.

She said: ""Most people have one of each sex and stop there.

""It is perfect to have an exact balance of boys to girls so we have 11 to 11.

""I can't wait to go shopping for lovely pink clothes for her now.""

Sue and Noel, who run a bakery in Morcambe, live in a 10 bedroom, four storey house which used to be a care home.

Sue - who was 14 when first child Chris was born - said after their last daughter, Bonnie, was born, they were not expecting any more.

She said their children were so excited that they decided to find out the gender of the unborn child rather than keep it a surprise.

They are parents to Chris, aged 30, Sophie, 26, Chloe, 24, Jack, 23, Daniel, 21, Luke, 19, Millie, 18, Katie, 16, James, 15, Ellie, 13, Aimee, 13, Josh, 12, Max, 10, Tillie, eight, Oscar, seven, Casper, six, Hallie, four, Phoebe, three, and Archie, two, and Bonnie, one.

Their new arrival is due in April next year.

The Radfords first found fame in 2012 when their lives were the focus of a Channel 4 documentary called 15 Kids and Counting.

Baby Bonnie was the last addition to the brood in November bringing the number of children to a whopping 21.

She arrived after a swift 12 minute labour weighing 8lb 4oz - and the couple, who have been having children for three decades, vowed she would be their last and had completed their family.

Sue and Noel run their own pie business and do not claim extra state benefits.

Some of the oldest offspring have since moved out and started families of their own with Sue and Noel being grandparents to four.

And when the entire family appeared on ITV's This Morning in January 2018, Sue said: ""Archie is definitely going to be the last Radford baby.""

But eldest daughter Sophie, who has three kids herself, shook her head and claimed she ""can't see her mum stopping"" - and she wasn't wrong as months later Sue fell pregnant with Bonnie.

Childhood sweethearts Sue and Noel's first child, Chris, was born when Sue was aged just 14.

The parents were both given up for adoption after they were born, and they decided to keep Chris and raise him as teenage parents.

They got married and had their second child, Sophie, when Sue was 17.

Noel even had a vasectomy, later reversed, after baby number nine.

The pair face a monumental task each day just to feed, clothe and ferry about their huge brood.

Those estimates often relied on national health surveys and people tend to understate their weight in those.The new work used a decades-long federal study in which weight was measured to get a more accurate picture of trends and to project into the future.""It's alarming,"" said a nutrition expert with no role in the study, Dr. Lawrence Appel of Johns Hopkins University. ""We're going to have some pretty awful problems"" medically and financially because so many people weigh too much, he said.The New England Journal of Medicine published the study Wednesday. It was led by scientists at Harvard and George Washington universities.Obesity raises the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer and other health problems. It's gauged by body mass index, or BMI, a measure of weight relative to height. Underweight or normal is a BMI under 25; overweight is 25 to 30, moderately obese is 30 to 35 and severely obese is 35 or over.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 40 percent of US adults are obese.The new research predicts that by 2030, about 49 percent of US adults will be obese.

668370,theduran--2019-09-18--Oil at 100 per barrel Attack on Saudi refineries could shake oil market further,2019-09-18,theduran,Oil at $100 per barrel? Attack on Saudi refineries could shake oil market further,"The drone strike on key Saudi oil facilities could stoke already-flaring tensions in the Middle East, driving crude prices higher amid growing fears of supply shortages, market and industry experts believe.

The devastating attack on major Saudi oil refineries at Abqaiq and Khurais slashed the kingdom’s output by 50 percent and knocked out more than five percent of global daily production. The consequences of the strikes led to uncertainty in the oil market as it’s unclear when the oil giant can restore operations to normal.

Analysts warn that it will take longer than had initially been thought to reopen the refineries, which were shut down after the strikes triggered massive fires there. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, believes several months will pass before the entire plants are back to normal, but production may actually be resumed earlier than that.

While Saudi Aramco facilities are offline, concerns of supply shortages are only rising. Crude prices are poised to soar, but by how much has experts divided.

“I’m anticipating that oil prices in the near term are going to rise an additional $3 to $5 a barrel, due to the increased amount of geopolitical tensions that we’ve seen since this attack occurred,” Lipow told RT.

However, not everyone agrees that squeezed output can push crude prices to $100. Market analyst David Madden of CMC markets argues that such a surge “is highly unlikely,” but still expects oil futures to trade higher.

“Maybe for Brent crude oil back up towards $72 or $75 [per barrel], perhaps, or West Texas Intermediate (WTI) up to between $63-65 [per barrel] in the next few weeks is likely,” Madden said in a phone interview.

Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader of OPEC, and other members of the oil cartel can offset the kingdom’s shortages if they come to an agreement on it with allied states, according to the analysts. Kuwait, the UAE and non-member Russia can use their spare capacities for it.

However, entities relying on Saudi imports can start seeking alternative supply sources, Abdessamad al-Azani, associate professor at the business and economics department of Qatar University, told Ria Novosti. In this way the US may become the main beneficiary of Saudi oil troubles.

“The US can become such an alternative, [US President Donald] Trump made it clear when he wrote that the shipments of oil from the Middle East are not necessary,” al-Azani said.",RT,https://theduran.com/oil-at-100-per-barrel-attack-on-saudi-refineries-could-shake-oil-market-further/,2019-09-18 10:35:16+00:00,1568817316,1569329993,"economy, business and finance",market and exchange

The former glamour model, 40, commanded attention on social media yesterday when she posted a full-length mirror selfie wearing nothing but a pair of knee-high pink socks.

While her bubblegum pink hair framed her features, the only things protecting her modesty were the silver bars of the weight-lifting equipment she was standing behind.

Jodie shared the racy photo with her 440,000 followers and had her fans asking what gym she was going to - as they want to join.

One fan wrote: ""Could do with knowing where that gym is?""

""I wanna train in that gym,"" another penned. ""Need a gym buddy Jodie? ;)"".

A fourth shared: ""If you ever need a incentive to get to the gym that’s it right there.""

It's not the first time Jodie has posed nude in the gym, she previously shared a similar photo of herself in 2016 with the bars of her weights in the same strategic place.

In January, Jodie's ex-boyfriend, Wayne Lennox, slammed her in a shock Facebook rant - claiming that the star made him choose between her and his children before their bitter split.

Wayne branded Jodie an ""evil bully"" and threatened to reveal ""every single detail"" of their relationship if she ""continues to bully"" him.

Over Christmas, Jodie announced that Netflix filmmaker Wayne was ""the one"", before revealing their shock split on New Year's Eve.

Jodie claimed that the director's ""secret children"" were the reason that their romance had soured, but Wayne tells a different story.

Writing on his social media page, he shared: ""I wasn’t going to say anything, but when someone drags your mum, your children and family’s name through the mud and into the newspapers I feel like I have to put some facts into the world.""

Dubbing Jodie's recent comments ""traumatic"", Wayne continued: ""There is a sad irony that the girl saying (and making money) from these stories is allegedly an anti bullying champion, so to see her go and try bully me and my loved ones so publicly has been a shock.

""I can tell you I was the one who walked out the door. I won’t go into details as to why, I won't stoop down to her level of cyber bulling either, let’s just say when you're given an ultimatum a) the girl who I’ve seen for a few weeks or b) seeing my children I'm going to choose my children over anything.

""My children are my life, and no one should have to choose between seeing your kids or seeing a partner.

""You can read all over her blogs and social media that she has had a problem with my kids since the very start.""

Jodie previously claimed that she ""felt sick"" and wanted to ""bathe in bleach"" after she learned that Wayne had hidden a third child by a third woman from her.

Taking to Instagram at the time, she wrote: ""So having spoken to loads of ex girlfriends now, on email, over messenger and over the phone I have just found out that my ex had not two kids by two different women but THREE kids by THREE different women.

""The whole relationship he hid his third kid from me. Wtf?! My mind is blown.

""I may have been an easy target and I may have believed his lies for a short while but I am SO happy to have gotten out when I did...

""I had my eyes opened on NYE as to who he really was and I’m now finding out the extent of his lies.""

10271,aljazeera--2019-02-24--Cubans vote on new constitution to replace Cold War-era charter,2019-02-24,aljazeera,Cubans vote on new constitution to replace Cold War-era charter,"Cubans began voting on Sunday in a referendum on a draft constitution to update its 1976 charter on the heels of significant economic reforms on the island over the past few years.

The new constitution, approved in the National Assembly late last year after a popular consultation, enshrines private property and promotes foreign investment. State enterprise remains the cornerstone of the economy, though the new constitution dictates state-owned companies have autonomous management.

On the political front, the document limits the president to two consecutive five-year terms, but does not open the door for Cubans to elect the president directly. The Communist Party remains the central political force in a one-party system.

Jose Jasan Nieves, editor at the non-state media outlet El Toque, told Al Jazeera by legalising economic measures put in practice in recent years, the new constitution ""adapts"" to a set of reforms already under way.

""This is the first opportunity the Cuban people will have in 43 years to express 'yes' or 'no' in the face of a government programme,"" he said. ""That is a unique opportunity because it will allow us to know what percentage of the Cuban society will start to express dissent.""

He estimated one-quarter of voters could reject the new constitution.

Eight million Cubans are eligible to vote on Sunday. The polls will close at 6pm (23:00 GMT) local time. More than 225,000 electoral authorities will oversee the vote, while some 200,000 students will steward the ballot boxes.

The electoral commission will release preliminary results in a press conference Monday at 3pm local time (20:00 GMT).

""This constitution is a step forward, we cannot deny that. But I think most Cubans were hoping for more,"" Camilo Condis, an entrepreneur in Havana, told Al Jazeera. ""Most of the changes in the Constitution are to legalise what was already happening in the country.""

Economic reforms introduced under former President Raul Castro in 2010 and 2011 to encourage self-employment and entrepreneurship ""helped to boost the private sector"", said Condis, who rents out a residence and works as a contractor for restaurants. But he added that the rollback in US-Cuban relations under President Donald Trump has created fresh challenges.

Now, he sees the Cuban government's approach to private enterprise as an effort to ""regulate but not shrink the private sector"". Close to 600,000 people are currently self-employed in Cuba, up from 150,000 in 2010.

For Maria Jose Espinosa Carrillo, director of programmes and operations at the Washington-based Center for Democracy in the Americas, one of the positive outcomes of drafting the new constitution has been the public debate that grew out of a three-month consultation process. Nearly nine million people attended public meetings to discuss an earlier draft of the Constitution, putting forward more than 700,000 proposals.

""For the first time, people had the opportunity to debate on issues that hadn't been part of grassroots debates before,"" Espinosa Carillo told Al Jazeera. ""This, together with access to the internet, has brought new platforms for discussion that was previously not public.""

She expects such public debate to be an ""increasing trend"", especially through new digital media outlets, Twitter, and other online platforms.

After the popular consultation, the drafting commission made 760 changes to the draft constitution, revising about 60 percent of articles in the document.

Critics say it was not clear how the commission evaluated and incorporated feedback. More than 11,000 proposals called for a direct vote for the president, for example, but the suggestion was not included in the text.

Meanwhile, marriage equality sparked a debate that is likely to continue after the referendum. An earlier version of the draft constitution defined marriage as a union between two people. But the final draft sidestepped outright legalisation after evangelical protests, leaving the definition of marriage to be determined in a separate referendum at a later date.

""It created a big debate, which is positive because it gave space and visibility to tensions that are happening and that people maybe weren't even aware of,"" Maria Isabel Alfonso, professor of Spanish and Cuban studies at St. Joseph's College, New York, told Al Jazeera.

State-led mobilisations ""are progressively being replaced by these spontaneous associations and ways of thinking"", said Alfonso, creator of the documentary, Rethinking Cuban Civil Society, and cofounder of Cuban Americans for Engagement, an organisation that promotes the normalization of US-Cuba ties.

""Many of them are very emphatic that they don't want to be in the opposition because the opposition receives, in many instances, funds from the US government,"" she added.

Nieves agreed the debate is ""complex and varied"" beyond clear cut ""yes"" versus ""no"" or government versus opposition lines.

""These sectors - journalists, intellectuals, artists, entrepreneurs, LGBTI activists, animal rights activists, religious activists - are sectors of a thriving, growing civil society that don't necessarily have an agenda of opposition politics, but rather of participation and defence of their respective interests,"" he said.

Changes to political and social rights in the Constitution include broader recognition of freedom of thought and expression, a right to request and receive information from the state, and the ability to hold dual citizenship.

The document expands non-discrimination to include on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in addition to sex, gender, age, ethnic origin, skin colour, religious belief, and ability. On women's rights, the new text guarantees women's sexual and reproductive rights and protects women from gender violence.

Cubans living abroad also were able to submit proposals for the new constitution in the public consultation process. ""That was a great step to include the diaspora,"" said Espinosa Carillo.

However, other than diplomats, Cubans abroad will not be allowed to vote in the referendum unless the return to the island to cast their ballots.",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cubans-vote-constitution-replace-cold-war-era-charter-190224035045660.html,2019-02-24 17:18:45+00:00,1551046725,1567547504,religion and belief,religious belief

Despite a General Motors strike, 128,000 jobs were added in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report — about 8,000 fewer jobs than were added in September.

Economists predicted the General Motors strike would heavily impact the October jobs report, predicting that only 89,000 jobs would be added and that unemployment would rise to 3.6%, according to CNN. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% in September, the lowest unemployment rate since December 1969.

“Even though much of the expected October slowdown will likely be due to temporary factors, we don’t want to ignore the impact the trade fight is having on business job decisions,” Beth Ann Bovino, US chief economist for S&P Global Ratings, told CNN.

Economists also worried before the jobs report was released that the economy would lose jobs during October.

“Some months are just bad, while other months are just good — and usually it doesn’t matter,” Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, told CNN.

Job growth has come back strong after February, when just 33,000 jobs were added.

The unemployment rate has held steady between 4% and 3.7% for more than a year before the April jobs report showed it drop to 3.6%. Prior to April’s report, the consistent unemployment rate suggested that workers are jumping back into the workforce to fill open jobs, rather than the workers who are currently collecting unemployment welfare, according to The Wall Street Journal.",Daily Caller,https://thepoliticalinsider.com/october-jobs-report-128000-jobs-added-unemployment-at-3-6/,"Fri, 01 Nov 2019 14:34:30 +0000",1572633270,1572646598,labour,unemployment

One person was killed and dozens were injured.

The storms were among 53 twisters that forecasters said touched down on Monday across eight states stretching eastward from Idaho and Colorado.

Jeffrey Hazel, the mayor of Celina, near Dayton, said 81-year-old Melvin Delhanna died during the tornado “as a direct result of a vehicle entering his house”.

In Mercer County, where Celina is located, emergency management director Mike Robbins said that 12 people were injured in the storm. Mr Hazel said three of those injuries are considered to be serious but none are life-threatening.

The National Weather Service (NWS)  said on Tuesday morning that roughly five million people throughout the state had been affected by the power outages.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Prediction Center showed that 14 suspected tornadoes touched down in Indiana, 11 in Colorado and nine in Ohio.

Dayton, the fifth-largest city in Ohio with 140,000 residents, was particularly affected. Nearly 60,000 residents were without power after the storm.

Homes and apartment complexes were levelled during the storm, devastating residents and leaving authorities scrambling.

“I don’t know that any community that is fully prepared for this type of devastation,” Dayton assistant fire chief Nicholas Hosford said on ABC’s Good Morning America.

The city tweeted that first responders are currently “performing search and rescue operations and debris clearing”.

The NWS says that it “will be conducting damage surveys for the next few days”. Utilities are expecting restoration to take several days.

For now, Dayton city officials have asked residents to conserve water, as power was lost in the city’s water plants and pump stations.

Montgomery County, where Dayton is located, Miami County, and Greene County were the most affected by the tornadoes, which authorities described as large and dangerous. The National Guard has been deployed in the aftermath.

Tornadoes also touched down in nearby Trotwood, where the mayor told residents that power lines and trees were down.

While it's not exactly news to most that waiting times for GP appointments in the UK have become increasingly lengthy, it nevertheless remains an issue that affects large swathes of the country. The NHS requires future-proofing more than ever to continue serving a growing population effectively, so it comes as no surprise that a new generation of tech is being created to help improve it.

​Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock unveiled the NHS Long Term Plan ​and ​promised the health service would be harnessing new technology over the next 10 years to improve the quality and speed of diagnoses​. Skype is one such example. The Microsoft-owned video messaging platform will be used to conduct 90 million outpatient hospital appointments​, ​rather than​ holding them​ in person.​ While it might seem fairly mundane in comparison to some of the futuristic tech on the horizon (like robots that can detect depression, smartphone ultrasounds for diagnosis on the go, and a DNA test to spot cancer), Skype, and platforms like it, could provide a swift solution to a debilitating everyday problem for doctors and patients alike. ​",Hajra Rahim,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/16/need-rethink-nhs-can-provide-telegraph-readers-future-proofing/,2019-01-16 12:11:33+00:00,1547658693,1567552205,health,health organisations
36706,bbcuk--2019-02-12--Can video consultations combat global doctor shortages,2019-02-12,bbcuk,Can video consultations combat global doctor shortages?,"Would you be happy to see your doctor online? Growing numbers of patients seem to be attracted by the convenience. And doctors are also finding it useful as health services come under pressure from growing and ageing populations.

Lydia Campbell-Hill, a 35-year-old doctor from Cornwall, England, says switching to online consultations has transformed her life.

""As a 'part-time' GP [general practitioner] working three days a week, I was doing 39 hours or more,"" she says.

""I was solo parenting, paying vast amounts on childcare, and not seeing my child much.""

After leaving her clinic-based job and working mainly online from her lounge or kitchen, she says: ""My stress levels dropped and I can fit my hours around school, even working a couple of hours in the evening after my son has gone to bed.""

Doug Sweeny, from US primary care provider One Medical, says giving doctors the flexibility to work remotely greatly improves their quality of life.

""The virtual team, they may have kids at home, they may be in places like Hawaii,"" he says.

""It works brilliantly, it actually helps if you need a flexible schedule or are in an area [where] we don't have bricks and mortar.""

Quality of life is one thing, but telemedicine is also about hard-headed economics.

""A significant portion of the patients doctors see daily are quick follow-ups of well-managed, long-term conditions, lab results, or script renewals,"" says Oyuka Byambasuren, a Mongolian GP researching technology and healthcare delivery, ""and these can be addressed through teleconsultations.""

It is a point echoed by Luke Buhl-Nielsen, from Swedish telemedicine app KRY (which uses the name LIVI outside Scandinavia).

""In Sweden, up to 45% of the volume that comes into general practice can be dealt with digitally,"" he says.

And virtual visits are roughly two-thirds cheaper to provide than in-person visits, research suggests.

Doctor shortages is a growing problem around the world.

The US could have up to 50,000 fewer than it needs by 2030, research firm IHS Markit believes. In Asia, the doctor shortage is fuelling the rapid rise of telehealth apps such as Halodoc, Doctor Anywhere, and Ping An Good Doctor.

Private equity firms and venture capitalists are piling in to the sector, investing billions, as healthcare providers respond to the app-savvy, more consumer-focused generations.

Nearly two-fifths of Americans aged 22-38 now seek routine medical services virtually these days, says a digital health survey from consultancy firm Accenture.

And this generation demands more convenient appointment times and a better service than that enjoyed by their elders.

""People are wanting to receive healthcare with the simplicity and convenience they receive in other services in their life,"" says Brian Kalis, Accenture's head of digital health services.

The number of virtual visits to the doctor in the US will reach 105 million by 2022, up from 23 million in 2017, says IHS Markit.

Celina Schocken has gone to the doctor virtually for a year.

""You go to the app and request a consult, and then it assigns you to a nurse or doctor, they open your electronic chart, and it feels like a FaceTime session,"" she says.

Ms Schocken, a 46-year-old consultant in Washington DC who works on women's health in developing countries, says she enjoys not having to waste time in waiting rooms running the risk of catching flu from other patients.

The service costs $200 (£154; €176) a year to join and online consultations are free. But in-person visits and other services are extra.

""It is really clean and efficient, and I love it,"" she says.

Telemedicine has particularly taken off in Nordic countries, and is popular with women in Turkey, where birth control is coming under attack, according to analytics firm App Annie.

Employers are also cottoning on to the benefits of telemedicine as a workplace perk. In the US, retail chain Walmart is offering employees doctor's appointments for $4 if they use a telemedicine service.

""Employers are very sensibly appreciating that booking a meeting room for a 15-minute Skype consult is more productive than missing maybe an entire day to attend a GP appointment,"" says Dr Campbell-Hill.

But there are challenges integrating telemedicine into healthcare systems, like Britain's or Canada's, that are paid for primarily from taxation.

In the UK, for example, National Health Service GP surgeries receive a fixed amount of money for each patient on their books.

The patients with easily treatable conditions effectively subsidise those with more complex conditions who require more care and attention.

So the concern is that telemedicine services could simply ""cherry pick"" the younger, healthier patients, leaving bricks-and-mortar surgeries with less money to treat those patients who are more expensive to treat, warns Dr Campbell-Hill.

And while chatbot-based health apps, such as Babylon, are also proving useful for initial triage or assessment of simple patient conditions, there are some concerns about how accurate the artificial intelligence (AI) underlying such chatbots really is.

Dr Annette Neary, a former NHS consultant now based in Galway, Ireland, says: ""Chatbot algorithms frequently ask overly broad questions and often come up with bizarre diagnosis options.""

She Wasn’t.,"A woman leaving the Tampa Internartional Airport on Monday got into the wrong Uber. For some reason, she thought she was being kidnapped and sold into sex slavery.

Later, the woman penned this harrowing Facebook post about the incident, which has been shared half a million times. She wrote:

Last night I was picked up by an Uber. Same car, female driver. I MADE A MISTAKE. I got in before checking, as she opened the back door for me from her seat. She drove erratically and didn't speak. About 10 minutes in, my actual Uber called me asking where I was. My voice cracked, because in that instant I knew. ""A car... I think I need help."" She told me not to hang up and to get out of the car however I possibly could. The lady refused to stop or respond to me. I told her she was driving by my friends (random girls I saw) and they would call the cops. She slowed a little, pointing at her phone saying ""Uber. I take you back then."" I said, no here is fine. She kept going. I booked it out the door, car still moving. She sped off. I later was told by numerous people she is a sex traffic worker. They use women to lure people in, and possibly hang out in the Uber lot to steal rides of similar looking cars. The cops didn't come, but my real Uber driver did Cristin Cinquino, and hugged me, kept me safe, and cried with me. Always, always check your Uber. I'm lucky.

Actually, she was unlucky. She got in the wrong Uber and it proceeded to take her in the wrong direction. But as the Orlando Sentinel soon reported:

Tampa police, however, say it was all a misunderstanding. Hurley's ride wasn't a kidnapping situation, and the driver wasn't a sex-trafficking victim, police said. Instead, Tampa police spokesman Eddy Durkin said, the woman was just another Uber driver with a similar car, whose primary language is Spanish and who doesn't speak much English, leading to the confusion. ""The person that posted it got into the wrong car and there was a language barrier,"" Durkin told the Orlando Sentinel on Wednesday. ""It's as simple as that. This had nothing to do with sex trafficking.""

The police checked out the story with everyone involved and consider the case closed.

But why did this woman immediately assume she was being sex-trafficked—and why did half a million people gullibly share her story?

The answer to the first is because sex trafficking is a moral panic. It has become a go-to eyeball-getter in the media, where it is portrayed Taken-style: Some random stranger grabs a random young person and sells them at the equivalent of a Sotheby's auction.

This is nonsense. As Beth Boggess, FBI supervisory special agent who heads Colorado's violent crimes against children unit, explained to KUSA TV:

But if sex traffickers aren't kidnapping people right and left, why does a Facebook post like this one get shared so much?

I think there's two things going on, besides a mistaken perception of the magnitude of this crime. Firt, people love to be helpful. If all it takes to save a life is to press ""share,"" who wouldn't? Second, people love to be at the center of excitement. If, by sharing this post, we are playing a small role in this thrillingly heinous story, well, it's better than no walk-on part at all.

The problem is that sharing this post does not spread helpful advice. It spreads unnecessary fear.

Instead, consider sharing this very post, or this one, or any of Elizabeth Nolan Brown's articles on the subject.

961861,thesun--2019-05-21--Woman celebrates WEDDING anniversary to French bridge six years after marrying the handsome stone,2019-05-21,thesun,Woman celebrates WEDDING anniversary to French bridge six years after marrying the ‘handsome’ stone structure,"AN Australian woman who married a BRIDGE has revealed they are celebrating their wedding anniversary after she fell in love with the structure six years ago due to a bizarre relationship disorder.

Jodi Rose, from Sydney, fell in love with Le Pont du Diable in Ceret, also known as 'The Devil's Bridge', when she was travelling through southern France in 2013

Falling head over heels for the 14th century structure, Jodi, who is known as Mrs Pont du Diable, married the bridge in an intimate service in front of 14 guests, and the mayor of the neighbouring town, Saint-Jean-de-Fos.

Six years after their nuptials, Jodi has spoken out about object personification synaesthesia, the disorder which causes her to associate inanimate objects with personalities, genders and even feelings.

And ultimately, it was the disorder that meant she fell in love with the stone bridge, which wears a custom-made giant ring to signify it's marriage to Jodi.

She told Channel 7 of her wedding day: ""I was really quite nervous before the wedding - I felt like a bride and it felt really, really beautiful and exciting.""

Explaining there are many attributes that attracted her to her husband, she added: ""He's very handsome, strong and sturdy - and I felt that he is someone I can connect with and who I feel will give me some grounding.""

But ultimately she wants everyone to know that there's 'someone' out there for them - even if that means, like it does for her, that it's an object other's might not understand.

""There's someone out there for everyone,"" she added. ""Or some bridges, chandeliers, pool floats. Something for everyone. There's no limit to love and the way you can feel, experience and express love.""

Before getting married, Jodi wrote on her blog that while the bridge may not outwardly express feelings to others, the Pont du Diable is something she feels 'connected' with, and keeps her 'rooted to the ground'.

She wrote in 2013: ""The Devil's Bridge is everything I could desire in a husband - he gives me a safe haven and lets me follow my own path, without trying to keep me tied down.

""I am devoted to him, though he understand I love other bridges - and men. Our love is one that embraces life, materialised in the swirling river that flows before his magnificent body.""

Sadly for Jodi, her marriage to Le Pont du Diable is not legally recognised by the French authorities, but she regularly returns to France to check on her lover.

And while she champions his 'great pylons', she is yet to disclose whether she and her stone lover are yet to consummate their marriage sexually.

While the union might seem strange, sexologist and object personification expert Dr Amy Marsh says the disorder is more common than you might think.

She explained to Channel 7: ""Many people have very robust, rich, complex relationship with an object or maybe even a number of objects.

""Object personification synaesthesia is where you can sense personality in objects. And while it might seem alien and strange to us, the feelings are very real for the person who has that going on.""",Jessica Lester,https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/9125439/woman-celebrates-wedding-anniversary-to-french-bridge-six-years-after-marrying-the-handsome-stone-structure/,2019-05-21 21:59:24+00:00,1558490364,1567540298,human interest,anniversary
54887,birminghammail--2019-01-21--Hour by hour weather forecast for Birmingham with city braced for -3C freeze as Met Office issues wa,2019-01-21,birminghammail,Hour by hour weather forecast for Birmingham with city braced for -3C freeze as Met Office issues warning,"Birmingham faces temperatures which feel as cold as MINUS three degrees tomorrow, it has emerged.

The Met Office has issued a weather warning for the city as the agency warns over ice.

Meteorologists are expecting traffic and travel chaos and have issued a yellow alert for ice across the city and Midlands.

The region will be affected by the alert from midnight tonight until midday Tuesday.

Birmingham is not the only city affected by the warning, either, with the agency issuing an ice alert for almost all of the UK.

But in the city, it will feel teeth-chatteringly cold, as Arctic winds spark plunging temperatures.

The mercury will drop to around freezing but, worryingly, will feel even colder.

Ice will become a major threat to drivers, pedestrians and cyclists starting Monday night as temperatures drop following rainfall, and wintry showers move into some areas.

Public Health England's cold weather alert is at level three - one stage below ""national emergency"".

Ice will form on some surfaces overnight into Tuesday morning across much of the UK, the agency warns.

Heavy rain will arrive from the west, with some hill snow.

Clearing eastwards overnight, with many areas becoming dry, but wintry showers are likely in the north.

After a frosty and icy start, there will be sunny spells.

Showers in the west will move eastwards though, with sleet and hill snow possible, and it will feel cold.

Some injuries from slips and falls on icy surfaces are expected, the Met Office warns.

Brummies should also be warned of ice on some roads, pavements and cycle paths.

Some roads and railways will be affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services.

Chief Meteorologist Steve Willington said: “The cold weather will continue to bring a risk of snow showers, icy conditions and widespread overnight frosts during the first part of the week.

“Though parts of England and Wales will see low cloud giving way to sunny spells on Monday, elsewhere, strong winds, heavy rain and hill snow will move into north-western areas.

""Wintry showers of rain, sleet, hail and snow will then follow from Tuesday.""

Public Health England's cold weather alert is at level three (""severe weather action"") - its second-highest level - in the North West and North East, and level two or one for the rest of England.

Dr Emer O’Connell said: “Experience shows us that every winter thousands of people are seriously affected and even die from illnesses linked to the cold.

""Protecting yourself from the cold may seem like common sense but many people do not manage to keep themselves warm.

“If you know someone at risk, someone over 65, anyone with dementia or a heart and lung condition, or a young child, check up on them and see if there’s anything you can do to help.

""All of us should be heating our homes to at least 18C, keeping up to date with weather forecasts and planning our days around them - simple steps can really help protect against the cold.”",James Rodger,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/hour-hour-weather-forecast-birmingham-15708830,2019-01-21 12:43:42+00:00,1548092622,1567551458,weather,weather forecast
228832,globalresearch--2019-04-09--Even Saudi Arabia Threatens to Ditch Dollar for Oil Trade over US Bullying Policies,2019-04-09,globalresearch,Even Saudi Arabia Threatens to Ditch Dollar for Oil Trade over US Bullying Policies,"Saudi Arabia threatens to sell oil in currencies other than the dollar if Washington passes a bill exposing the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to U.S. antitrust lawsuits.

The No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (NOPEC), which was introduced by Democrat Senator Herb Kohl in 2000 and received backing from Donald Trump in 2011, has never been approved and has little chance of being passed.

This legislative proposal aims to allow OPEC oil companies to be sued under the U.S. antitrust law for their attempts to set international prices by limiting oil supplies, a practice which has been regularly applied as a way of stabilizing the global market.

The Saudi Arabian threat makes visible a growing discontent over the way the U.S. treats OPEC countries. According to Reuters, senior Saudi energy officials have been analyzing the ditching-dollar-oil-trades possibility for several months and would have already mentioned reported it to U.S. officials.

In the unlikely event that Saudi Arabia were to adopt this new policy, it would undermine the dollar status as an international reserve currency, which could weaken in turn the U.S. ability to enforce economic sanctions on nation states.

Russia, China and some European countries have been calling for reducing the dollar’s influence in international trade. If this happens, the U.S. would lose a significant part of its ability to control both the world economy and its own growth.

Due to President Trump’s aggressive foreign policy, however, Russia, Venezuela and Iran, all of which are being placed under harsh U.s. economic sanctions have been selling their oil in Euros, Yuans or other traditional or virtual currencies.

Non-dollar oil contracts are concrete challenges to the U.S. hegemony at the oil market. If Saudi Arabia makes a move in that sense, it would also mean a heavy blow to the U.S. geopolitical strategies.

Saudi Arabia, which controls a 10th of global production, made oil deals for US$356 billion in 2018, which made it the world’s biggest oil exporter.

At a price of US$70 per barrel, the global oil output is estimated to be about US$2.5 trillion. At least 60 percent of this amount is now being traded in dollars.

In addition, oil futures and options trading reached a nominal value of US$5 trillion in 2018, as reported by Reuters.

491076,slate--2019-10-04--This Supreme Court Term Will Launch a Conservative Revolution,2019-10-04,slate,This Supreme Court Term Will Launch a Conservative Revolution,"After Brett Kavanaugh joined the Supreme Court in October 2018, most of the justices seemed eager to do whatever they could to keep SCOTUS out of the limelight. Less than two weeks earlier, Christine Blasey Ford had declared on live TV that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her as a teenager; Kavanaugh, in response, accused Democrats of orchestrating a “grotesque character assassination” driven by “pent-up anger about President Trump” and “revenge on behalf of the Clintons.”

The Supreme Court’s legitimacy rests in large part on the perception it is a nonpartisan institution, but Kavanaugh joined the bench engulfed in a toxic cloud of political rancor. In the year after the ugly confirmation hearing, the justices mostly kept their heads down, ducking many controversial cases for no apparent reason. They decided only two bona fide blockbusters, throwing partisan gerrymandering claims out of federal court and blocking the census citizenship question. Meanwhile, they dodged cases about Dreamers, abortion, religious freedom, and discrimination, effectively deciding not to decide.

But the Supreme Court has amassed far too much power to avoid any contentious issue for long. As Congress remains deadlocked and the White House melts down, SCOTUS has become the only fully functioning branch of the federal government. It has taken on the role of policymaker, obligated to resolve many of the battles that engulf the political branches. Republicans understand this fact, and it is a key reason why they fought so hard for Kavanaugh’s confirmation. With lawmakers paralyzed, momentous disputes wind up at the Supreme Court. And now, thanks to Kavanaugh’s vote, many of these battles will be decided by a 5–4 conservative majority.

A slew of potentially earthshaking cases has already piled up on the court’s docket for the upcoming term. Multiple transformative decisions will come down in June, thrusting the court into the middle of the 2020 presidential campaign. And the full impact of Kavanaugh’s appointment will become clear as the court is dragged further to the right. This jurisprudential bloodbath will heighten the stakes of the 2020 race, amplifying the power of the president and the role of the judiciary in the most explosive political fights of the day.

Potentially earthshaking cases have already piled up on the court’s docket for the upcoming term.

The term will begin with a bang, with oral arguments over whether states can abolish the insanity defense. Four states have outlawed this defense—which allows defendants with mental illnesses to acknowledge their crime but argue a lack of culpability—even though it’s been a universal feature of criminal law for most of American history. Without Justice Anthony Kennedy’s moderating influence on Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, the conservative bloc may bless the abolition of the insanity defense, ensuring that more people with mental illnesses are locked up in prison without access to appropriate treatment.

A day later, the court will hear arguments in three cases that ask whether federal law prohibits employment discrimination against LGBTQ people. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars workplace discrimination “because of … sex.” And it is impossible to discriminate against LGBTQ people without taking sex into account. Consider an employer who fires a man for marrying a man but does not fire a woman for marrying a man. This discrimination is inherently based on sex: change the male employee’s sex and he wouldn’t be fired. Now consider an employer who fires a trans woman because she is trans. That termination turns on her sex—the fact that she does not identify as a man.

There is another reason why it would be bizarre to subtract LGBTQ employees from federal protections. The Supreme Court has ruled that sex stereotyping—punishing workers for failing to confirm to gender norms—is a form of sex discrimination prohibited under Title VII. Discrimination against gay people rests on the ultimate sex stereotype: the belief that men should only be romantically involved with women, and vice versa. Discrimination against transgender people, too, is rooted in sex stereotyping—a belief that individuals should conform to the sex they’re assigned at birth as well as the attendant gender norms.

Dozens of lower court judges, including numerous Republican nominees, have reached these conclusions with ease. But there is little reason to be optimistic that the new conservative majority will agree. Conservative advocacy groups, including some that supported Kavanaugh’s and Gorsuch’s confirmations, have lobbied against an LGBTQ-inclusive interpretation of Title VII. So, too, have a number of congressional Republicans who endorsed both justices. There is also the possibility that the conservative justices on the bench today hold anti-LGBTQ beliefs that will cloud their analyses of the issue. A 5–4 decision along ideological lines excluding LGBTQ employees from Title VII seems disturbingly probable.

A week later, SCOTUS will hear arguments in a seemingly dry clash over executive power. In theory, the case asks only whether the Constitution’s appointments clause applies to Puerto Rico’s Financial Oversight and Management Board, which Congress created to restructure the island’s debt. If so, the president must nominate each member of the board and obtain Senate confirmation.

But this case could be a Trojan horse that strips U.S. territories and the District of Columbia of home rule. If the appointments clause applies to the Puerto Rico board, it may also apply to territorial governments more broadly. That would give the president of the United States the power to choose the governors of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. He could also select high-ranking executive officials in each territory—as well as the D.C. mayor. Residents of U.S. territories and D.C. could no longer elect their own leaders. If the court hands down a sweeping decision, Trump, facilitated by a GOP-controlled Senate, could seize control over every territorial government.

The next day, the court will hear a dispute over whether states can prosecute immigrants who use false Social Security numbers. Immigrant rights advocates argue that the federal government has sole authority to charge this crime, but red states are trying to seize the power to punish unauthorized immigrants themselves. A few hours later, the justices will take on a case about Lee Boyd Malvo, who was 17 years old when he helped John Allen Muhammad murder 10 people during the “D.C. sniper” shootings. Malvo, who regrets his actions, is serving life in prison, but he has sought resentencing under SCOTUS precedents that sharply limit juvenile life without parole. In Kennedy’s absence, the conservative majority may roll back those decisions and give states leeway to keep juvenile offenders behind bars until they die.

In November, the hits will just keep coming. On Nov. 12, Trump’s attempt to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, will finally come before the court. (The justices punted this case for months last term to avoid deciding it in 2019.) President Barack Obama created DACA to let certain undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children live and work here legally. The Trump administration tried to wind it down—but DACA’s defenders argue that it did so illegally, on the mistaken premise that the program is unlawful. A majority of the court may rule that Trump has discretion to reverse his predecessor’s policy however he wants. It could also take a leap forward and declare that DACA itself is unconstitutional. Either decision would trigger a humanitarian crisis, placing 800,000 Dreamers in danger of deportation.

That same day, the court will hear arguments in Hernández v. Mesa, a truly horrific case. The facts are ghastly: In 2010, a Border Patrol agent shot and killed an unarmed 15-year-old Mexican boy across the border. His family argues that the Constitution’s prohibitions on such police brutality provide them with a right to damages. If the court rules against them, it could strip everyone—citizens and undocumented immigrants alike—of the ability to sue federal law enforcement for misconduct. And recent precedents suggest that the conservative justices are prepared to slam the door on such claims.

One day later, the justices will consider Comcast v. National Association of African American–Owned Media, a potential atomic bomb for race discrimination law. Section 1981, a federal statute first passed in the wake of the Civil War, guarantees racial minorities the right “to make and enforce contracts.”

This rule is expansive: It applies to independent contractors, unlike Title VII, and bars race discrimination in retail, education, and public accommodations. A federal appeals court ruled that, to win under Section 1981, plaintiffs need only prove that race was one factor in their mistreatment. Comcast wants to defang law by requiring plaintiffs to prove “but-for” causation—meaning they would not have faced discrimination but for their race. The conservative justices favor this stringent standard, which would compel plaintiffs to uncover evidence of blatant racism. Since that evidence almost never exists, a decision importing “but-for” causation into Section 1981 could kneecap the law.

In December, the court will hear arguments in a Second Amendment case for the first time since 2010. It will decide whether New York City’s strict gun laws—which bar residents from traveling with firearms unless they’re going to a city shooting range—is unconstitutional. The court will say it is. In the process, it will bring the right to bear arms out of the home and into the streets, setting the stage for a future decision that creates a constitutional right to public-carry. (New York City has already repealed the law in question and argues that the case should be dismissed; the plaintiffs vigorously disagree.)

When the court returns from the winter holidays, it will hear another landmark case: Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue. This case is, at bottom, an effort to force states to fund religious education. The plaintiffs argue that once states subsidize private schools, they must also subsidize parochial schools. It appears that the conservative justices agree with that proposition, even though it directly violates the constitutional separation of church and state. If the court sides with the plaintiffs, the roughly 30 states that use vouchers or tax credits to support private schools would have to open up their programs to religious schools. Taxpayers, by extension, would be compelled to fund the exercise of religion.

Guns, immigration, executive power, police brutality, criminal justice, race discrimination, church-state separation, LGBTQ rights—what other issue could the Supreme Court possibly take on to make this term more incendiary? Ah, yes: abortion, of course! Sometime in 2020, the court will hear June Medical Services v. Gee, a challenge to Louisiana’s targeted regulation of abortion providers (or TRAP law). The state passed a stringent law that compels these providers to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital—a virtually impossible task that provides no health benefit to women. In 2016’s Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, the Supreme Court struck down an identical law. Kennedy provided the fifth vote. After he stepped down, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Louisiana law, defying Whole Woman’s Health. In February, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Louisiana law by a 5–4 vote, sparing the states’ clinics, which were prepared to shutter. Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberals; Kavanaugh dissented.

Roberts likely voted to freeze the law to remind lower courts that they cannot ignore binding precedent. But he dissented in Whole Woman’s Health and is no fan of abortion rights. The Supreme Court will now have to decide whether a constitutional right to abortion access still exists in a post-Kennedy world. Do not expect Roberts to side with the liberals this time around. He may not have wanted the 5th Circuit to overrule Supreme Court precedent. But he may be happy to overturn Whole Woman’s Health himself, giving states the green light to regulate abortion clinics out of existence.

The justices may prefer to avoid the grimy political arena, but over the next eight months, the court will take center stage. As these decisions come down, the court will inevitably become a flashpoint in the presidential campaign. Liberal voters will demand to know what Democratic presidential hopefuls plan to do about the judiciary, and candidates will embrace court packing with more enthusiasm.

As the new majority launches a conservative revolution in constitutional law, ushered in by Kavanaugh’s elevation to the bench, Democrats will learn, over and over again, how much damage Trump has inflicted on the progressive project. And they will be forced to contend with a wildly powerful judiciary poised to obstruct progressive reforms while shattering liberal precedent. The Supreme Court is not yet in the forefront of the 2020 race. By the time this term is over, traumatized Democrats may struggle to talk about anything else. Perhaps Democrats will espouse a vision of progressivism that is less reliant upon the judiciary for success. They may conclude that it is not healthy for a democracy to depend so extensively on the rule of five justices in Washington.",Mark Joseph Stern,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/10/supreme-court-term-preview-conservative-revolution.html?via=rss,2019-10-04 09:58:00+00:00,1570197480,1570633616,education,religious education

Islamic cultural center to be built at site of 9/11 attacks.

The highly controversial ‘ground zero mosque’ project that was shelved after numerous protests appears to be back in the form of a 16,000-square-foot Islamic cultural center set to be built in the same place in Manhattan.

The ‘ground zero mosque’ (originally named Cordoba House) was envisioned as a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque in Lower Manhattan. It would have replaced a building that was damaged during the 9/11 attacks by plane parts and accommodated a “prayer space” for up to 2,000 Muslims.

Following widespread controversy and opposition from 9/11 families, the project was abandoned, but an Islamic cultural museum with a Muslim “prayer space” was subsequently built and recently completed.

However, it appears as though a larger new mosque is being planned for the site.

New York YIMBY reports, “Construction has also yet to begin on 51 Park Place, which is slated to become a 71-foot-tall, 16,000-square-foot Islamic cultural center.”

According to anti-Islam activist Pamela Geller, developer Sharif El-Gamal has learned from the ground zero mosque controversy and is trying to keep the new project secret.

“El-Gamal has many friends and allies among New York City’s political and media elites,” she writes. “It is likely that de Blasio city officials and the New York Times and other city papers all met with El-Gamal and agreed to keep the reporting on this project to an absolute minimum, so that it could get built without incurring the righteous anger of the public again. The first time around, they courted publicity and tried to make El-Gamal a hero. We demolished that and destroyed their plans. So now they’ve clearly decided to go ahead surreptitiously.”

Geller continues to insist that the notion of building a mosque at the site where Islamic terrorists slaughtered thousands of Americans is a deliberate provocation.

“It is…an Islamic pattern to build triumphal mosques on the cherished sites of conquered lands,” writes Geller. “History is riddled with triumphal mosques built on the sites of jihad attacks or appropriated from other religions: the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque on the site of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, and innumerable mosques built on the sites of Hindu temples that were demolished by Muslims all attest to that.”

472305,rightwingwatch--2019-01-31--More Bible Teaching in Public Schools What Could Possibly Go Wrong,2019-01-31,rightwingwatch,More Bible Teaching in Public Schools: What Could Possibly Go Wrong?,"A national campaign to undermine church-state separation—Project Blitz—encourages like-minded state lawmakers to introduce legislation designed to move more of the Religious Right’s worldview into law—and into public schools. This week President Trump gave an endorsement-by-tweet to one specific Project Blitz goal—getting more public schools to teach about the Bible.

There are many reasons to be deeply skeptical of the current push by right-wing organizations for more Bible teaching in public schools. Religious Right activists have turned public schools into culture-war battlegrounds, routinely denouncing Supreme Court rulings from the 1960s that upheld church-state separation by forbidding state-sponsored prayer and devotional Bible readings in public schools.

One of Project Blitz’s promoters is “historian” David Barton, a Republican political activist whose WallBuilders organization promotes a Christian-nation approach to U.S. history that has been widely discredited by actual historians. Making the Bible a primary textbook in American public schools is one of the goals of Christian nationalist political operative David Lane, who hosted President Trump at one of his events during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Earlier this month, controversial Florida legislator and pastor Kimberly Daniels filed HB 195, legislation that would amend a current state law that permits school districts to offer elective Bible classes. Daniels’ bill would require every school district in the state to offer a set of courses about religion, the Hebrew scriptures, and the Christian Bible. Daniels, a self-described “demon buster” and “apostle,” has sponsored other Project Blitz legislation, including a bill to require public schools to post “In God We Trust” in “a conspicuous place.” (That legislation became law last year.) God TV celebrated the introduction of Daniels’ new bill, saying it brought Florida “[o]ne step close to seeing prayer in public schools again.”

Courts have ruled that teaching about the Bible—as literature, for example, or as comparative religion—is constitutional in public schools, but using the Bible for indoctrination or proselytizing is not. Teaching about the Bible’s role in history is permissible; teaching the Bible as if its stories are factual history is not.

In order to help school officials understand and navigate these tricky legal waters, People For the American Way Foundation worked with scholars and organizations across the political spectrum to produce “The Bible & Public Schools: a First Amendment Guide,” which was published in 1999 by the Freedom Forum’s First Amendment Center and the National Bible Association. The guide makes clear that teaching the Bible in public schools in a neutral and academic way requires a serious commitment to, among other things, the selection and training of qualified teachers.

It’s not easy to do correctly, especially if there’s no will or effort to do so.

In 2000, People For the American Way Foundation published “The Good Book Taught Wrong,” the results of an in-depth investigation of the way “Bible History” was being taught in 14 Florida school districts. The investigation, grounded in written course materials obtained by PFAW Foundation, documented that all of the school districts had been “violating the U.S. Constitution by teaching the Bible from a religious perspective—often assuming teachers and students were Christian—or using the Bible as if it were a history textbook or otherwise failing to provide objective and secular instruction.”

Among the details included in the PFAWF report were this question which appeared on tests in two high schools: “Why is it hard for a non-Christian to understand things about God?” Another high school exam question asked, “If you had a Jewish friend who wanted to know if Jesus might be the expectant [sic] Messiah, which book [of the Gospels] would you give him?” Another lesson asked, “Who, according to Jesus is the father of the Jews?” The answer: “The devil.”

The Texas Freedom Network Education Fund has published multiple reports on the way Bible classes have been taught in that state’s public schools.  Southern Methodist University religious studies professor Mark Chancey has documented that classes were being taught from a right-wing fundamentalist Christian standpoint, including a literal interpretation of the Bible, with materials “designed to evangelize rather than provide an objective study of the Bible’s influence.”

In addition, noted Chancey in a report originally published in 2006, Bible courses often fostered “notions of American identity as distinctively Christian,” using videos and materials from Barton’s WallBuilders. Chancey described WallBuilders’ “America’s Godly Heritage” video as “so inaccurate in its content and so unabashedly sectarian in its goals that one federal court has prohibited its use in public schools.”

Daniels’ new bill requiring all Florida school districts to offer multiple courses on the Bible includes language stipulating that the courses must maintain religious neutrality and not promote or disfavor any particular religious outlook. That’s a good thing. But as the PFAWF and TFN studies make clear, it’s one thing to require neutrality, and it’s another thing to ensure that course materials, teacher training, and actual classroom practice reflect those legal requirements.

If states continue to expand teaching about the Bible in public schools, there will be a lot of work for parents, teachers and other concerned individuals to make sure that public officials are providing oversight and accountability to ensure that schools are respecting the Constitution as well as the rights of all students.",Peter Montgomery,http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/more-bible-teaching-in-public-schools-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/,2019-01-31 15:18:20+00:00,1548965900,1567550166,education,school

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for wind across Wales and southern and central parts of England.

It advised the public there could be disruption to roads and rail, and possible blackouts.

Overnight winds reached 79mph on the Isle of Wight and 67mph on the Isles of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall.

London and other inland regions are expected to weather gusts of 50 to 60mph early on Thursday morning, as the wind pushes further north.

While the winds will ease off into breezy weather mid-morning, leaving sunshine and showers, gusts are due to pick up again by midday on Friday, with a warning for then covering most of the UK and remaining in place until Saturday evening.

This will be accompanied by a warning for persistent heavy rain in Scotland, where as much as 60mm is forecast to fall over high ground. The Met Office said melting snow over the weekend would contribute to the risk of flooding.

It said there was also a risk of thunder and hail throughout the rest of the week.

He said: “Be mindful that there could be some tricky conditions on the roads, for example there will be strong winds that could affect transport, like high-sided vehicles crossing bridges, so there could be delays.”

386955,npr--2019-09-09--Typhoon Faxai Rips Through Tokyo Area At Least 2 Dead And 700000 Without Power,2019-09-09,npr,"Typhoon Faxai Rips Through Tokyo Area: At Least 2 Dead And 700,000 Without Power","Typhoon Faxai Rips Through Tokyo Area: At Least 2 Dead And 700,000 Without Power

Typhoon Faxai tore through an area just east of Tokyo on Sunday night and Monday morning, killing at least two people and injuring dozens more. The area's electrical infrastructure was hit hard, as strong wind gusts toppled two large steel electrical towers.

The death toll could rise as officials survey the damage. The Kyodo News Agency is reporting a third storm-related death, but it adds that the circumstances are still being investigated.

The Tokyo Electric Power Co. says more than 850,000 customers were initially left without power by the storm. By Monday night local time, that number had dropped to about 700,000.

More than 100,000 people had been urged to evacuate from low-lying and other vulnerable areas, as the Japan Meteorological Agency warned of a possible record storm.

Faxai forced the East Japan Railway Co. to suspend train service around Tokyo early Monday. It also forced more than 160 flights to be canceled.

Commuters who got up Monday morning hoping to make their way to work were faced with flooded streets and rows of utility poles that had been thrown down. Those who made it to train stations faced cancellations or long delays, as crews worked to restore service. One station's roof was blown onto its tracks.

Some of the worst damage came in the coastal Chiba prefecture, east of the capital across Tokyo Bay. On Sunday night, Faxai began plowing its way up the bay, bringing dangerous winds inland as it passed just west of Chiba City and making landfall early Monday. It then turned to the northeast and made its way back over the Pacific Ocean.

""The typhoon brought record-breaking winds to Chiba City, where winds gusted to over 200 kilometers per hour [124 mph],"" Japan's NHK News reports. ""Two people died in accidents apparently caused by the strong gusts — one in Tokyo and one in Kanagawa.""

Faxai is also being linked to a fire at Japan's largest floating solar power plant, which sits on the waters of the Yamakura Dam in Chiba prefecture. The 13.7-megawatt plant covers 44 acres, but dozens of its panels erupted in flames on Monday. According to NHK, fire officials say the typhoon's intense winds might have pushed the panels on top of one another, causing them to overheat when the sun hit the solar plant.

As images from the city of Ichihara in Chiba prefecture show, the typhoon also knocked down green safety netting at a golf driving range, sending an entire side of the assembly — support poles and all — crashing onto neighboring homes. The posts crushed the rooftops of houses as the large structure fell; in one case, a single pole was left sticking out of a roof.

Faxai struck just days after a separate typhoon struck the Korean Peninsula. Typhoon Lingling caused at least five deaths in North Korea, according to the country's state news agency. At least three people in South Korea died as a result of the storm, according to The Korea Herald.

Lingling damaged more than 9,400 buildings, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency says, noting that the storm brought the fifth-strongest winds of any typhoon that has ever been recorded hitting the peninsula.

""The Korea Central News Agency reports widespread damage"" in North Korea, reporter Jason Strother tells NPR from Seoul. ""It says Typhoon Lingling destroyed hundreds of homes, bridges, roadways and thousands of acres of farmland and now recovery work is underway.""

Emergency crews working to restore power and help those whose homes were damaged in southern South Korea are still facing difficult conditions, as heavy rains were forecast for both Monday and Tuesday.",Bill Chappell,https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/758978962/typhoon-faxai-rips-through-tokyo-area-2-dead-and-700-000-without-electricity?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=news,2019-09-09 14:02:10+00:00,1568052130,1569330709,weather,weather phenomena
4433,activistpost--2019-04-09--Good Samaritans Attacked Arrested for Helping Homeless People Not Freeze to Death,2019-04-09,activistpost,"Good Samaritans Attacked, Arrested for Helping Homeless People Not Freeze to Death","Lansing, MI — In January, temperatures in Lansing, Michigan plummeted far below freezing making it extremely dangerous for those who are homeless. Knowing people would likely freeze to death if they stayed outside, one couple decided to help out those less fortunate than them. However, instead of being praised for their good deed, the couple was arrested.

Julia Miller and Martin Mashon were handing out bus tokens in January so that homeless people could go to the bus station instead of staying outside and freezing to death. They are advocates for the less fortunate and during weather emergencies like this one, they often hand out coats and help people make it to warming centers. But on this particular day, the police would show up to put a halt to their kindness.

On January 26, during a polar vortex and weather emergency, temperatures had fallen well below zero so Mashon and Miller went to the CATA station to hand out tokens and try to save lives. But body camera footage shows that police showed up and acted like the couple was robbing the place.

“This isn’t a warming station, it’s a bus station so there’s no loitering,” the officer says after he ran up to the couple like there was some sort of emergency.

“But it’s a great place for people to stay warm,” said Mashon.

“I know it’s cold out,” said the officer in the video, “But that doesn’t give you a right to loiter somewhere, where loitering’s not permitted.”

According to many folks who have commented on the video, the director of the CATA bus station has an open door policy during cold weather and allows the less fortunate to “loiter” in the station to stay warm. However, it appears that the police wanted nothing of it.

Despite the director’s reported policy, the officer asked the couple of they were waiting for a bus.

“Then you’re gonna have to leave,” said the officer.

Mashon said, “Actually this is a warm place that I help pay for.”

After several minutes, the conversation got heated.

“No I’m trying to explain something to you and you won’t stop talking,” said the officer.

Mashon said, “Are you my master, am I your slave now.”

“Take your hand out of your pocket,” said the officer.

“Take your hand out of your pocket,” the officer repeats as he moves in to arrest Mashon.

“What do you have in your pocket,” said the officer. “Easy, easy, easy.”

Mashon said, “Let go of me. Why are you touching me?”

The officer then throws Mashon up against the window and puts him in handcuffs. Moments later he arrests Miller as well. Miller was charged with trespassing and Mashon was charged with trespassing and hindering an officer. Miller explained that they plan on fighting the charges and are asking for the police to apologize as well as implement a policy for helping the homeless during weather emergencies. “Don’t they understand that if they A. Drop all charges against both Martin and myself. B. Offer a public apology in regards to the excessive force and verbiage the officer used and C. Implement a plan of action that involves several local homeless advocacy groups in regards to what needs to be done during weather emergencies that the chances of us deciding to pursue a civil suit will lessen AND it will save them some face,” Miller wrote on Facebook. She says that is not likely to happen, however. Below is a video showing what helping the homeless looks like in a police state.

Imagine having a three-day weekend year-round, not including an extra day during holiday weekends!

Voting 17-0, the Philippine Senate approved on Monday a bill filed by Sen. Joel Villanueva that would allow Filipino workers to enjoy more flexible work schedules.

Under the proposed law, employees can opt out of rendering eight hours of work for five days a week. Instead, they can craft a “mutually agreed voluntary work arrangement” with their employer.

Workers may choose to serve longer hours for a fewer number of days as long as they can meet the prescribed workweek time frame, which is usually 40 hours.

Upon hearing the news, malls and shopping centers praised the Senate for the legislation.

A spokesperson for SM Malls told The Adobo Chronicles that if signed by the President,  the new law would mean bigger profit since consumers will have an extra day to shop or eat out at restaurants in the malls. A similar sentiment was expressed by the management of Ayala Malls.

Operators of beach and other recreation resorts said they couldn’t be more happy about the proposed law.

For the first time in Philippine history, a bill passed by the Senate has received overwhelming, if not unanimous support from the Filipinos.

107845,cnn--2019-11-21--Trump awards 8 National Medals of Arts and Humanities,2019-11-21,cnn,Trump awards 8 National Medals of Arts and Humanities,"Recipients included the chef at the Inn at Little Washington, 27-time Grammy Award-winning musician Alison Krauss, the best-selling novelist James Patterson and Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight.

""Great nations produce great thinkers, artists, musicians and scholars who make our world a more beautiful, enlightened and joyful place,"" Trump said during the awards reception in the East Room. ""Each of today's recipients has made outstanding contributions to society, culture and life. They exemplify the genius, talent and creativity of our exceptional nation.""

The White House announced earlier this week that the President would be awarding four of each medal, with some recipients being recognized as a group, such as the United States Military's musicians and the Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank.

The medal ceremony was the President's only scheduled public appearance on Thursday, which took place as members of Congress heard from witnesses during the fifth day of the public impeachment hearings . The President did not comment on the impeachment inquiry -- which is examining his alleged abuse of power -- during the East Room ceremony.

Voight is an outspoken Trump supporter and Patterson, who published a book co-written with former President Bill Clinton in 2018, is a member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago golf club. Trump called both men his friends when delivering remarks at the White House ceremony. There were a few odd moments during the East Room event. Voight at one point when loud music played off cue, began to dance on stage, by himself, in front of the audience and next to the President. And while congratulating author Patterson, Trump admitted he had sold more books than even Trump, though pointed out he hadn't sold more than the Bible. The medals have typically been awarded on an annual basis, but this will be the first time Trump has awarded the medals since taking office in 2017. In 2017, the 16 remaining members of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities resigned in protest of Trump's defense of white nationalists during demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia. The committee, established by then-President Ronald Reagan, was among the ceremonial White House committees tasked with advising the president on arts and humanities issues.",,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_allpolitics/~3/8d4ozxuZISQ/index.html,"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 21:58:59 GMT",1574391539,1574381397,human interest,accomplishment

692906,theguardianuk--2019-03-14--Chess England win first major medal in 22 years with silver at world teams,2019-03-14,theguardianuk,Chess: England win first major medal in 22 years with silver at world teams,"England’s silver medals on Thursday at the World Team Championship in Astana, Kazakhstan, were the team’s first of any colour in major competition since 1997. European gold in that year seemed the last hurrah of a generation which had proved itself No 2 to the former Soviet Union. Before that England won bronze at the 1989 world teams and the 1990 Olympiad but then the Berlin Wall came down and new strong chess nations appeared from Eastern Europe and Asia.

England proved themselves more consistent than their major rivals, China, India and the US, in Kazakhstan, although the margins were narrow. They were mentally tough, too, often fighting back strongly from dubious mid-session positions.

The team captain, Malcolm Pein, said: “We showed in Astana that, although our teams do not receive the official and financial backing of many of our rivals, our resilience and team spirit are second to none.”

Expectations at Astana were muted. Only four of England’s six world-class grandmasters were available, the team struggled with heavy colds in the first few days as it was minus 15 outside the playing hall, while Michael Adams, its lynchpin for two decades, was feeling the years at 47 and lost his first two games.

However, boards two to four, Luke McShane, David Howell and Gawain Jones, were all in medal-winning form. Tied matches against USA, Russia and India, all major rivals, were followed by convincing wins against the weaker Iran, Egypt and Sweden, with the only defeat coming against China in the penultimate round.

The final leading scores were Russia 16 match points (23.5 game points), England 13 (21), China 12 (21), India 11 (22) and USA 11 (20). McShane won the board two gold with 6/9, Jones the board four silver with 5.5/8 and Howell the board three bronze with 6/9.

The result has another significance for English chess, which has been dominated by Nigel Short and Adams for three decades. Currently the live ratings show that the England top five, the four in Astana plus Matthew Sadler, are all covered by a mere 14 rating points, with Howell fractionally ahead of Adams. Short, at age 53, has dropped out of the world top 100. Dominance has given way to primus inter pares.

Further down the line, the dearth of new potential global level talent is an increasing concern. Jones and Howell in the late 1990s were the last to show clear potential to reach a 2600 rating, the level of the world top 200 and a springboard for further progress.

There is an array of initiatives to encourage juniors, from grandmaster coaching for the most promising down to the very popular UK Chess Challenge, which has its early rounds in schools and attracts tens of thousands of boys and girls. But the implicit ceiling for achievement has become lower, so that the talents are satisfied to become a teenage international master or maybe to go for grandmaster norms in a university gap year.

Luke McShane’s victory against India was a key moment in his own and the team’s success, and demonstrated the subtleties of equalising then building an advantage with the black pieces. It was a humdrum Giuoco Piano (quiet game) until White’s committal 11 d4?! (Nbd2) gave him an isolated centre pawn.

More misjudgments by 23 Ne1?! (Qc2) and 25 Nd3? (Ba5) accentuated the isolated pawn weakness which in turn made his bishop less active than Black’s knight pair. So McShane offered the queen swap 27…Qd5! which White could not accept and left him in real trouble. The end was the simple tactic in this week’s puzzle, but McShane did the spadework far ahead of that.

115477,cnsnews--2019-09-27--Pope Francis The Church Values Sport in Itself,2019-09-27,cnsnews,Pope Francis: ‘The Church Values Sport in Itself’,"(CNSNews.com) - Pope Francis said today that the Catholic Church “values sport in itself” in an address he delivered to participants in the Semi-Annual Congress of the International Ice Hockey Federation.

“Sport is a very special channel for the promotion of peace and unity,” said the pope. “Sporting activities are meeting places where people of many different backgrounds come together.”

“It is also important to keep in mind that sport has a role to play in our growth and integral development,” he said. “That is why the Church values sport in itself, as an arena of human activity where the virtues of temperance, humility, courage and patience can be fostered, and encounters with beauty, goodness, truth and joy can be witnessed.”

Here is the full text of the pope’s remarks:

“I am happy to greet and welcome the participants of the International Ice Hockey Federation Semi-Annual Congress. I would like to thank the President of the Federation, Mr. René Fasel, for his kind words of greeting. “Sport is a very special channel for the promotion of peace and unity. Sporting activities are meeting places where people of many different backgrounds come together. Hockey is a good example of how sport can express a sense of community. It is a team game in which each team member has an important role to play. Whenever you take part in the World Championships, you can see how people from many different countries enjoy coming together to experience the beauty of sport. “It is also important to keep in mind that sport has a role to play in our growth and integral development. That is why the Church values sport in itself, as an arena of human activity where the virtues of temperance, humility, courage and patience can be fostered, and encounters with beauty, goodness, truth and joy can be witnessed (cf. Giving the best of yourself, 1 June 2018, 1.3). “As you are the leaders of international ice hockey, it is consoling to know that your goal is not only to control the guidelines and rules of the sport, but also to make it inclusive and available to individuals on a global level. Ice hockey requires unique skills and strength. Players have to master the techniques involved in skating and maintaining their balance on ice, and they also have to keep up with the movement of the puck and be able to get up after a fall. Sports like these require hours of training. As you support the development of this sport worldwide, you are encouraging young and old, men and women, to bring out the best of themselves and to promote friendly relationships on and off the ice rink. “Additionally, I would also like to acknowledge the fact that your organization received approval for its updated statutes and bylaws in May this year, and that a new Ethics Board has been included. Today’s culture may sometimes steer sporting activities down the wrong path, but we must keep in mind that rules are there to serve a specific purpose and to avoid a descent into chaos. Athletes honor fair play when they not only obey the formal rules but also observe justice with respect to their opponents so that all competitors can freely engage in the game (cf. ibid., 3.2). “With all of this in mind, I encourage you and your Federation to go forth and continue your special mission to make this sport inclusive and to ensure a safe community for all who take part. “May the Lord bless you and always give you the joy of sport being played together.

Speaking to the Alliance Defending Freedom in Arlington, the Vice President referenced a remark by the Commander-in-Chief:

And how do we do that? Perhaps it’s through communication with a higher power:

Pray for everyone hurt — the victims and the nation, broadly:

Belief in God is a strength, he explained. It binds us:

Horrifically, the tragedies in Texas and Ohio left over 50 wounded and registered a death toll of — as of August 6th — 31.

It’s certainly a grave wound to the American soul.

And no answers to “why” could possibly suffice.

But Mike pointed out that, historically, the country’s houses of worship have served as places of comfort — though times are certainly changing:

“From the American founding, voluntary associations — churches, synagogues, places of worship, and religious education — have been at the center of American communities and they are the wellspring of American strength. But as you all know well, we live in a time where we’ve seen people driving religion from the public square and it’s even become fashionable for many in the media and popular culture to mock religious belief.”

For those of you who prone to agree, consider the Vice President’s call to help heal the national hurt:

“Let’s pray for the people of El Paso and Dayton. As we pray, let us resolve to act to make our communities safer. Let us resolve that we will do our part to ensure that our heritage of family and faith and freedom is renewed and preserved for this generation and the next. “God bless the people of El Paso and Dayton and God bless all of you here to defend faith and freedom for the American people. And may God bless America.”

Phocine distemper virus (PDV) has been common in the northern Atlantic ocean for decades but as a result of melting Arctic sea ice it has now appeared among marine mammals in the northern Pacific ocean too.

The 15-year study which tracked the animals via satellite found PDV, which can kill some species, was most common in years when so much Arctic ice melted it became possible for mammals to move freely from the Atlantic to Pacific regions.

Steadily rising global temperatures due to climate change have meant more and more sea ice is melting around the Arctic, opening up sea lanes which for thousands of years have been impassable.

Between 1979 and 2018, Arctic sea ice declined on average 12.8 per cent each decade, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

“These sea ice changes in September are likely unprecedented for at least 1,000 years,” the IPCC said in a report published in September.

The scientists said a severe spike in PDV in 2003 and 2004 among marine mammals in the northern Pacific was connected to a record ice melt in August 2002.

Testing showed about 30 per cent of Stellar sea lions in the northern Pacific Ocean were infected with the disease, which had previously been mostly confined to Atlantic populations.

PDV did not peak again in the Pacific until 2009, which was also just one year after widespread melting in 2008 which created open water passage routes.

“The loss of sea ice is leading marine wildlife to seek and forage in new habitats and removing that physical barrier, allowing for new pathways for them to move,” one of the study’s authors Dr Tracey Goldstein, from the University of California, Davis, told the BBC.

“As animals move and come in contact with other species, they carry opportunities to introduce and transmit new infectious disease, with potentially devastating impacts.”

Symptoms of PDV include laboured breathing, fevers and attacks on the nervous system. It was first identified in the late 1980s after unprecedented epidemics swept through populations of seals and sea lions, beginning with landlocked seals in Lake Baikal in Siberia.

This first outbreak killed about 18,000 harbour seals in the North and Baltic Seas. Another epidemic in 2002 in the North Sea is believed to have wiped out more than half of the seal population in the region.",Tim Wyatt,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/arctic-sea-ice-virus-melt-seal-sea-lion-otter-study-pdv-a9196301.html,"Sat, 09 Nov 2019 12:13:00 GMT",1573319580,1573303421,health,non-human diseases

Sheffield United striker Sophie Jones, left, has been sacked and banned for
racially abusing Tottenham's Renee Hector

The 27-year-old from Liverpool was charged by the FA following a four week
investigation into the allegations made after the Women's Championship match
in January.

Jones denied the charge, but the panel were convinced there was enough
evidence to uphold the complaint.

Sheffield United Women have since terminated her contract after she was
suspended for five games.

She was also fined £200 and ordered to attend an FA education course.

A Sheffield United statement said: ""The club works closely with the EFL, the
FA and Kick it Out and would like to reiterate that it does not condone racism
or any form of discrimination.

""Following dialogue between the club and Jones, and taking into account the
length of the suspension, it has been decided that her contract, which was due
for review in the summer, will be terminated by mutual agreement.""

Defender Hector released a statement after the outcome was revealed and said:
""There is no place for racism in our game. A zero tolerance policy is
imperative in stamping this out from football therefore I welcome this
verdict.

""No should be subjected to racist abuse on or off the pitch and I felt a
responsibility to call it out for what it was.

""I want to now concentrate on the last five games of the FAWC and trying to
secure promotion with Spurs.

""Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this process.""

Cahill, who was making his Palace debut, was the subject of controversy in the first-half of his side's 2-1 win against United on Saturday afternoon.

The former Chelsea defender took Anthony Martial down on the edge of the penalty area at Old Trafford, but was only shown a yellow card for his challenge despite being the last man.

United players were furious when a red card was not shown to the veteran defender, but Cahill admits he was not feeling nervous as he awaited the referee's verdict.

""I was not nervous but I was not sure if it should have been a red card,"" Cahill told Match of the Day. ""It felt 50/50 between us both.

""It was a fantastic result, we had to dig in, we had to go hard. We did that and the counter at the end was fantastic. We needed a reaction after the game. We worked very hard, we had a bit of luck with the penalty miss but I think we deserve it.""

Palace manager Roy Hodgson also echoed the feelings of Cahill after the game, and insisted there was no debate as to whether the summer signing should have been sent off.

378899,newyorkpost--2019-07-27--Imam buried behind mosque sparks debate in Rockland County village,2019-07-27,newyorkpost,Imam buried behind mosque sparks debate in Rockland County village,"A mosque buried its imam in the backyard — and a little Rockland County village almost died of shock.

Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi al-Halveti, who founded the Jerrahi Order of America mosque in Chestnut Ridge, died at the age of 92 in February 2018.

He was laid to rest behind the house of worship a few days later. And in May of this year, the faithful erected a grand monument made from imported Turkish marble. A bench was installed next to it.

Etched into the marble tomb is one of the sheikh’s favorite sayings: “The most beloved of Allah’s servants are those who engender Allah’s love in his servants and their love in Allah.”

The gravesite is the picture of tranquility. But it has not been a peaceful resting place.

The issue of private burials has haunted the public discourse in this village of 8,000 souls ever since, with opponents — led by a retired FBI agent — saying backyard graves are public health risks and that village officials should never have OK’d one.

“I don’t think that an incorporated village where people live next door to one another on small or large parcels of land should allow the burial of human remains on properties,” said Hilda Kogut, the ex-Fed and chairwoman of Citizens United to Protect Our Neighborhoods, who called the town policy a “shock to the system.”

Embarrassed village officials soon claimed they tried to stop the burial, but didn’t have the legal authority to block it. The mosque, providing correspondence as proof, said it asked for permission from the village to bury their beloved imam, and received it.

The mosque “did it against our respectful wishes,” Chestnut Ridge Mayor Rosario Presti insisted.

The mosque’s current sheikh, Yurdaer Doganata, noted that the congregation followed “local safety codes and health regulations and used a traditional casket. It was a green burial and there were no chemicals used. The grave site was approximately six feet deep. A member of our community who is a licensed contractor performed the ground preparations.” The coffin was made from wood with no nails, he said.

The state does not have a law against home burial and allows local governments to pass their own ordinances regarding the practice. Chestnut Ridge has no law on the issue.

Such interments are safe, and not uncommon in others parts of the country, according to the Funeral Consumers Alliance.

“The myth of contagion from dead bodies is one of the most persistent of the American funeral industry,” reads the alliance’s website. “There is no evidence, peer-reviewed or otherwise, to justify it.”

Still, New Yorkers creeped out by the prospect of living among the dead, need not be; NYC forbids private, at-home burials.

Mayor Presti said the village hopes to soon draft an ordinance that bans backyard burials. But the late shiekh’s followers will not have to worry about an exhumation.

“You can’t unring that bell,” the mayor said.",Jon Levine,https://nypost.com/2019/07/27/imam-buried-behind-mosque-sparks-debate-in-rockland-county-village/,2019-07-27 19:27:27+00:00,1564270047,1567535634,religion and belief,religious facilities
173144,eveningstandard--2019-04-29--Cats should be banned from going outside to protect birds says Royal Parks conservation officer,2019-04-29,eveningstandard,"Cats should be banned from going outside to protect birds, says Royal Parks conservation officer","Pet cats should be banned from venturing outside to stop them killing birds, according the Conservation Officer for the Royal Parks in London.

Tony Duckutt, who has overseen Regent Park’s rare birds since 1978, said cats are the cause of many bird deaths.

“These so-called pets shouldn't be allowed to roam freely, s******* in other people's gardens, killing birds or just putting them off,” he told The Telegraph.

“The owners have no right spoiling other people's enjoyment.”

“I'd love to take their s*** back and scatter it over their owners garden.”

""It's so wrong. The law again fails to defend the the home owner.

“As well as killing millions of birds they have brought the Scottish Wildcat to the edge of extinction.""

However, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home told the paper: ""Cats are naturally independent and territorial animals that enjoy exploring their surroundings and marking an area as their own.

“Outdoor access provides great opportunities to display natural, normal feline behaviours including roaming and hunting to help stimulate and engage cats and support their emotional and physical wellbeing.

“Battersea will always seek to rehome a cat to somewhere with outdoor access so that the cat can get the benefits of both worlds – indoor home comforts as well as outdoor adventures.""

Royal Parks also made it clear that the comments did not reflect the charity's general view.

241432,hotair--2019-09-09--UC Irvine professor End of democracy near because cultural elites no longer control the media,2019-09-09,hotair,UC Irvine professor: End of democracy near because cultural elites no longer control the media,"Politico Magazine published a piece Sunday about the work of a UC Irvine professor named Shawn Rosenberg. As described by author Rick Shenkman, Rosenberg is the elite equivalent of a guy marching around wearing a sandwich board that reads: The end is nigh! Professor Rosenberg believes Democracy is nearing its end in the modern world because elite voices don’t have power over the thoughts and opinions of the rabble that they used to have.

Rosenberg, who earned degrees at Yale, Oxford and Harvard, may be the social scientist for our time if events play out as he suggests they will. His theory is that over the next few decades, the number of large Western-style democracies around the globe will continue to shrink, and those that remain will become shells of themselves. Taking democracy’s place, Rosenberg says, will be right-wing populist governments that offer voters simple answers to complicated questions. And therein lies the core of his argument: Democracy is hard work and requires a lot from those who participate in it. It requires people to respect those with different views from theirs and people who don’t look like them. It asks citizens to be able to sift through large amounts of information and process the good from the bad, the true from the false. It requires thoughtfulness, discipline and logic. Unfortunately, evolution did not favor the exercise of these qualities in the context of a modern mass democracy. Citing reams of psychological research, findings that by now have become more or less familiar, Rosenberg makes his case that human beings don’t think straight. Biases of various kinds skew our brains at the most fundamental level. For example, racism is easily triggered unconsciously in whites by a picture of a black man wearing a hoodie. We discount evidence when it doesn’t square up with our goals while we embrace information that confirms our biases.

There are no footnotes in this piece so I don’t know which study of unconscious racism the author is referring to. I do know that one of the best-known tests to purportedly reveal unconscious bias, the IAT, is junk social science. If Rosenberg is relying on the IAT to inform his position then his position needs revision.

The author argues that democracy peaked in the 20th century and is slipping now but this seems counter-intuitive. Is there anyone who would argue racial bias is more prevalent now than in the 1950s when Jim Crow laws were still legal? Granted we may all have biases but hasn’t there been some social progress in the past 70 years? And if so, why is democracy struggling more now than it was then? It’s not clear if Rosenberg has addressed that question directly, but he does have an explanation for why things are worse now than in the past: elite control over the masses has waned.

When people are left to make political decisions on their own they drift toward the simple solutions right-wing populists worldwide offer: a deadly mix of xenophobia, racism and authoritarianism. The elites, as Rosenberg defines them, are the people holding power at the top of the economic, political and intellectual pyramid who have “the motivation to support democratic culture and institutions and the power to do so effectively.” In their roles as senators, journalists, professors, judges and government administrators, to name a few, the elites have traditionally held sway over public discourse and U.S. institutions—and have in that role helped the populace understand the importance democratic values. But today that is changing. Thanks to social media and new technologies, anyone with access to the Internet can publish a blog and garner attention for their cause—even if it’s rooted in conspiracy and is based on a false claim, like the lie that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring from the basement of a Washington D.C. pizza parlor, which ended in a shooting. While the elites formerly might have successfully squashed conspiracy theories and called out populists for their inconsistencies, today fewer and fewer citizens take the elites seriously.

Don’t you feel terrible about the twilight of the elites who were so fragile they could be easily demolished by bloggers? You don’t? Me neither.

This whole tale strikes me as a very partisan reading of what is essentially a bipartisan issue. Professor Rosenberg apparently cites Pizza-gate (a stupid right-wing conspiracy theory) but doesn’t mention 9/11 Trutherism which at one point led 1/3rd of Democrats to answer that President Bush knew about the attack in advance.

In fact, there is evidence that both left and right are pulling away from each other, though the people doing the pulling on each side are a small but vocal minority. And neither side has a monopoly on authoritarianism. Reason reported on a study about left-wing authoritarianism last year:

Once all of the numbers were crunched, the researchers’ results were consistent with the authoritarianism symmetry hypothesis. In fact, after sorting participants into conservatives and liberals based on whether they scored in the top or bottom half of a 10-point conservatism scale, the researchers found that “the highest score for authoritarianism was for liberals on LWA.” “Our data suggest that average Americans on the political left are just as likely to be dogmatic authoritarians as those on the political right. And those left-wing authoritarians can be just as prejudiced, dogmatic, and extremist as right-wing authoritarians,” Conway tells PsyPost.

Anyone paying attention to college campuses in the past few years can see that left-wing authoritarians are alive and well. In those circumstances, it’s usually the conservatives upholding the traditional liberal values of logic and mutual respect while their progressive opponents seek to shout them down.

As for the self-appointed elites, if they aren’t as respected as they used to be that’s partly because we’ve learned that their pronouncements often carry a lot of partisan freight. Indeed it seems almost anything can win the approval of today’s academic elites so long as it appears to give voice to progressive views.",John Sexton,https://hotair.com/archives/john-s-2/2019/09/09/uc-irvine-professor-end-democracy-near-cultural-elites-media/,2019-09-09 22:43:25+00:00,1568083405,1569330719,science and technology,social sciences

In 2019, could U.S. government leaders further resolve to improve healthier eating as well, joining public health experts in seeing that food is medicine?

In 2018, Congress initiated a series of actions that represent a shift away from placing the full responsibility – and blame – on individual people to make their own healthier choices. These actions also show a growing recognition that many stakeholders – including the government – are accountable for a healthier, more equitable food system. This shift in thinking reflects an understanding that government can and should play a role in improving the diet of Americans.

As faculty members at Tufts University, our expertise spans clinical medicine, nutrition science, public health, policy analyses, Congress, federal agencies and government programs. It’s clear to us that the time is right for meaningful policy action to leverage food as medicine.

Poor diet is among the greatest health and societal challenges of our time, causing death and disability, soaring health care spending, budget challenges for governments and private business, diminished military readiness and population disparities.

Medicare and Medicaid, the government programs that pay for medical care for people over age 65, low-income families, and the disabled, now consume US$1 in $4 in the federal budget. In addition, nearly $1 in $5 in the entire U.S. economy is spent on health care, creating massive threats to the health of the national economy.

Diet-related diseases are major contributors to these expenses. For example, the annual medical and economic costs of heart disease and stroke are estimated at $316 billion; of diabetes, $327 billion; and of all obesity-related conditions, $1.42 trillion. These costs create enormous economic challenges for federal and state governments as well as for private American businesses, families, and individuals through rising health care premiums, out-pocket-costs, missed work and lower productivity.

Diet-related health burdens and costs also influence military readiness. Two-thirds of active duty military forces are overweight or obese, while 71 percent of young Americans are unable to join the military for one or more reasons, with obesity as the leading medical disqualifier.

The overall U.S. food system – including farming and imports, supermarkets and retail, restaurants and cafeterias, and food manufacturers – also reflects and contributes to profound disparities, especially among children. Minorities and the poor often have the worst diets, causing a vicious cycle of poor health, lower school performance, lost productivity, increased health costs and poverty.

As policymakers increasingly recognize the depth and breadth of these effects, they are beginning to act. In January 2018, House lawmakers created a bipartisan “Food is Medicine” working group, dedicated to innovations in nutrition policy to improve health and reduce diet-related health costs. Simply the existence of a group in Congress focused on “Food is Medicine,” which hosted multiple briefings for congressional staff on key legislation to integrate nutrition into federal policy, is an advance.

On June 7, 2018, Congress instructed the U.S. Government Accountability Office to perform a comprehensive assessment and accounting of all federal policies related to food, chronic diseases and health care costs. The GAO is the government “watchdog,” providing independent audits of agencies and policies. The GAO has been asked to investigate six specific questions across diverse federal agencies and programs, including the evidence linking diet to chronic diseases, the corresponding national and federal health care costs, and the current strategies and missed opportunities to reduce these risks and costs. A series of GAO reports on food policy will likely come out in 2019 and 2020. The launch of this investigation represents a federal milestone for its scope and recognition of the opportunities in food policy.

The 2018 Farm Bill, signed into law on Dec. 20, 2018, included several important provisions for healthier eating, especially in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which supports about one in seven Americans. This included expansion of the fruit and vegetable subsidy program to $250 million, a new $25 million Produce Prescription Program and strengthening of SNAP-Education, a $400 million/year nutrition education program. Several of these advances were recommended by the 2018 Bipartisan Policy Center report on healthier SNAP, chaired by former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D., and USDA Secretaries Ann Veneman and Dan Glickman.

While there were advances in the Farm Bill, a proposed amendment to include pilot testing for medically tailored meals was rejected. Medically tailored meals are ready-to-eat, personalized meals provided at home to low-income patients with complex medical illnesses like cancer, HIV, diabetes or heart failure. Several recent studies show that providing medically tailored meals to patients is associated with reduced hospitalizations, emergency room visits and overall health care spending. While this is a missed opportunity in the Farm Bill, the state of California is currently testing the effects of medically tailored meals on health outcomes and costs in a $6 million Medicaid intervention across six counties, which will provide new evidence for possible future national expansion.

Among the Farm Bill changes, we believe that the new Produce Prescription Program holds special promise. Already offered by some nonprofit and private insurance programs, this new federal program will allow doctors to prescribe not just medications but also subsidized purchases of fruits and vegetables. While the $25 million represents a small relative investment, this direct federal commitment to evaluate produce prescriptions in health care has the potential to provide evidence to support future expansion throughout Medicaid and Medicare.

Together, these congressional activities in 2018 represent an evolution toward incorporating and addressing nutrition, diet-related diseases and their health care costs in federal policy. These actions build upon mounting public awareness of the central role of food in well-being; the accelerating consumer demand for, and corresponding industry shifts toward, healthier foods; and the growing recognition that individual consumers cannot be solely responsible for the current challenges in the food system.

The recent congressional actions toward viewing food as medicine coincide with new scientific evidence on how specific government policies can improve nutrition and well-being, reduce health care costs and reduce disparities.

We believe that meaningful progress on these national challenges will require far more substantive policy changes that can make healthier eating the easy, accessible, less expensive option. Based on recent reviews of the science as well as our new research, particularly promising federal government strategies for consideration include:

Policy change is often not linear. Based on the significant impacts of nutrition on disease, health care, the economy, military readiness, disparities and the environment, federal actions in 2018 laid the foundation for nonpartisan federal leadership to create meaningful and lasting solutions.

150270,drudgereport--2019-07-25--CDC Fertility rate all-time low,2019-07-25,drudgereport,CDC: Fertility rate all-time low...,"(CNN) The general fertility rate in the United States continued to decline last year, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics .

""The 2018 general fertility rate fell to another all-time low for the United States,"" the researchers wrote in the report, published Wednesday.

The report found that the general fertility rate dropped 2% between 2017 and 2018 among girls and women age 15 to 44 nationwide.

Now the center's latest report presents selected highlights from that 2018 birth data.

For the report, researchers examined birth certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System's Natality Data File, taking a close look at births among white, black and Hispanic women in 2018.

When examined by race, the data showed that fertility rates declined 2% for white and black women, and 3% for Hispanic women, between 2017 and 2018.

The data also showed that the teen birth rate, for ages 15 to 19, fell 7% from 2017 to 2018. When examined by race, the data showed that teen births declined by 4% for black teenagers, and 8% for white and Hispanic teens.

Also among all births, the percentage delivered at less than full term, or 39 weeks, increased -- with preterm births climbing from 9.93% of births in 2017 to 10.02% in 2018, and early-term births rising from 26% in 2017 to 26.53% in 2018.

The percentages of births delivered at full-, late- and post-term declined, according to the data. Full-term births were down from 57.49% of births in 2017 to 57.24% in 2018, the data showed, and post-term births declined from 6.58% to 6.2%.

""The continuing shift toward increased maternal age at first birth is something that does increase the risk. However, it does not fully explain the increase in the preterm birth rate. So that's one of the challenges here, I think, for the nation,"" he said. ""There is a lot more work that needs to be done as the preterm birth rate continues to rise.""",,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DrudgeReportFeed/~3/C6w7Bt0TSMs/index.html,2019-07-25 23:28:37+00:00,1564111717,1567535886,society,demographics

15353,aljazeera--2019-08-24--New fires in Brazils Amazon as army mobilises to fight blazes,2019-08-24,aljazeera,New fires in Brazil's Amazon as army mobilises to fight blazes,"Hundreds of new fires are raging in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, according to official data, as six of the nine states in the region requested military assistance to combat the record blazes.

The states of Para, Rondonia, Roraima, Tocantins, Acre and Mato Grosso requested the army's help, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles announced on Saturday, one day after President Jair Bolsonaro authorised the military to step in.

Data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) said some 1,663 new fires were ignited between Thursday and Friday. More than 1,200 of those fires were in the Amazon region.

Official figures recorded 78,383 forest fires in Brazil this year, an 84 percent rise over last year's figure. More than half of those were in the Amazon region.

Environmentalists have said farmers clearing land for pasture were responsible for the uptick in fires.

The Amazon is the world's largest tropical rainforest and its protection is seen as vital to the fight against climate change because of the vast amounts of carbon dioxide it absorbs.

Some 44,000 troops will be available for ""unprecedented"" operations to put out the fires, Defence Minister Fernando Azevedo said.

He added that the military's first mission will be the deployment of 700 troops to the area around Porto Velho, capital of Rondonia, where the military will use two C-130 Hercules aircraft capable of dumping up to 12,000 litres of water on fires per journey.

On Friday, multiple fires were seen were raging across a vast area of Rondonia, billowing huge plumes of smoke into the air, AFP news agency reported.

Several residents of Porto Velho said what appeared to be light clouds hanging over the city of half a million people was actually smoke from the blazes.

The Brazilian military operations came after widespread criticism of Bolsonaro's handling of the crisis.

Azevedo defended the government response, saying that it was ""very fast"".

""It shows the concern of Bolsonaro's government about this issue,"" he said.

The defence minister noted US President Trump's offer, on Twitter, to help Brazil fight the fires but said there had been no further contact on the matter.

""Any help is welcome in respect to the fires,"" he added.

Alfredo Sirkis, executive director of think-tank Brazil Climate Center and a founder of Brazil's Green Party, said while he supported military involvement, he doubted that anyone would be able to put out the fires.

""Once you have a huge forest fire like that, especially when you don't have all the kind of forest fire-fighting equipment that you have in places like the US or Portugal, it's difficult to extinguish,"" he told Reuters.

""They'll only be extinguished by themselves depending on the weather conditions.""

Environmental specialists say the fires are coming amid increasing deforestation in the Amazon region, which in July took place at a rate four times that of the same month in 2018, according to data from INPE.

Bolsonaro has previously attacked the institute, describing its data as lies and engineering the sacking of its head.

The blazes have stirred outrage globally and are a major topic of concern at the G7 meeting in Biarritz, France. The growing crisis also threatens to torpedo a trade deal between the European Union and South American countries, including Brazil, that took 20 years to negotiate.

Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, told reporters at the G7 that it was hard to imagine European countries ratifying a trade pact with the Mercosur bloc as long as Brazil fails to curb the fires ravaging the Amazon.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who has taken the lead in pressing his Brazilian counterpart over the fires, had earlier accused Bolsonaro of lying to him about Brazil's stance on climate change.

In an escalating war of words between the two leaders, Bolsonaro denounced what he calls Macron's ""colonialist mentality"".

""There are forest fires all over the world, and this cannot be used as a pretext for possible international sanctions,"" Bolsonaro said on Friday.

Earlier in the week, he had accused non-governmental organisations of deliberately starting the fires after their funding was cut.

Brazil's powerful agriculture sector - which strongly supports Bolsonaro - has expressed concerns over the president's rhetoric, fearing boycotts of their products in key markets.

The Folha de S Paulo newspaper, in an editorial on Saturday, the warned that Bolsonaro's ""bravado"" had worsened the crisis caused by accelerating deforestation.

""The damage to [Brazil's] image is done and it could have important trade repercussions,"" it said, adding: ""Nationalistic bravado will not win the game this time.""",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/fires-brazil-amazon-army-mobilises-fight-blazes-190824185613901.html,2019-08-24 23:34:53+00:00,1566704093,1567533515,"disaster, accident and emergency incident",accident and emergency incident
698616,theguardianuk--2019-04-24--Dutch fence off tulip fields to stop selfie-takers crushing flowers,2019-04-24,theguardianuk,Dutch fence off tulip fields to stop selfie-takers crushing flowers,"Barriers and advertising banners are being erected around fields in the tulip bulb region of the Netherlands in an attempt to deter a growing number of tourists from flattening the flowers to take selfies.

Tourists have been seen jumping above the tulips to secure the perfect picture, or lying down in the middle of fields, squashing the bulbs.

Simon Pennings, a grower near the town of Noordwijkerhout in the bulb region of south-west Netherlands, was the first to erect a barrier in his field, emblazoned with the slogan of a pilot campaign backed by the local tourist board: “Enjoy the flowers, respect our pride.”

“They are so careless,” Pennings said of the tourists. “We get large groups of people visiting, which we find very nice and fun, but they flatten everything. It is a shame and we suffer damage as a result. Last year, I had a plot with €10,000 [£8,700] in damage. Everything was trampled … They want to take that selfie anyway.”

Nicole van Lieshout from the local tourist office said a group of 40 “ambassadors” – a voluntary team of guides, including retired farmers – will seek to teach visitors about the history of the tulip fields.

“In recent years, the number of tourists coming has been higher and higher,” said Van Lieshout. “I think the tourists think the fields were made for them. Everyone wants the perfect selfie and the pictures go all over the world, lying or dancing among the flowers.

“We don’t want to send the tourists away. The farmers make the fields beautiful for the visitors, but pictures need to be taken on the edge of the fields, not in or on the flowers.”

Pennings told the Dutch newspaper the Algemeen Dagblad people were generally respectful when they were educated about the fields.

“They don’t think about it,” he said. “People have lost sight of how a plant grows and that we are working on it all year round. When I explain that to people in the field, they say, ‘Oh, oh, yes, you’re right’, and ‘I’m sorry I didn’t see it at all and didn’t understand it’.

“It’s largely ignorance. I assume that. Milk also comes from a factory and not from a cow. That is also the case with the bulbs. It is thought that it is a kind of plastic.”

The Dutch tourism board has made a “dos and don’ts” guide to taking a selfie near a tulip field.

Van Lieshout said growers’ difficulty in dealing with the interest in tulips had been highlighted over the weekend when the roads into the Keukenhof, a 32-hectare (79 acre) floral garden where growers showcase their latest flowers, became gridlocked. Drivers had spilled out of their cars and into the fields.

The annual number of visitors to the Keukenhof has risen from 800,000 to 1.4 million in the past six years. The garden’s director, Bart Siemerink, described the situation as “unacceptable for residents and entrepreneurs in the bulb region”.

The curse of the selfie-taking tourist is not a new phenomenon. Last summer, the New York Times reported on the case of the Bogle family, who had opened their farm in Ontario to allow visitors to wander past tall sunflowers. After eight days, the family shut the gates, blaming hordes of amateur photographers who trampled on plants in order to secure the best selfie, plucked sunflower heads to use as props and left rubbish strewn across the farm.",Daniel Boffey in Amsterdam,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/netherlands-tulip-fields-barriers-tourists-selfie-takers,2019-04-24 10:47:43+00:00,1556117263,1567541932,human interest,plant

The poignant mural is of reindeer taking off into the sky next to, what will now become, an iconic bench in Vyse Street in the Jewellery Quarter .

An image of the Banksy and a homeless man called Ryan lying on the bench was posted on the fabled artist’s Instagram on Monday.

Banksy said: “God bless Birmingham. In the 20 minutes we filmed Ryan on this bench passers-by gave him a hot drink, two chocolate bars and a lighter - without him ever asking for anything.” #Banksy.”

It's today emerged that the artist has created merchandise for a concert in aid of homeless charities in his hometown of Bristol.

T-shirts with a festive design will go on sale at the Give a Sh*t Xmas concert, which also features an appearance by IDLES, at Bristol's Marble Factory on Thursday.

It was started two years ago by Portishead's Geoff Barrow and his band Beak will also play live on the night, while Martin Roberts from Homes Under The Hammer will compere.

All proceeds from the shirts will go to local charities The Wild Goose, 1625 Independent People, Feed the Homeless Bristol and Somewhere to Go.

Meanwhile, back here in Birmingham, the Banksy's paint work was 'defaced by a vandal' who reportedly shouted out ""shall i tag it?"" before spraying red noses on the reindeers.

Graffiti artist 'Hers' contacted BirminghamLive on Tuesday claiming he was responsible for the additional paint work.

The 25-year-old, from Quinton , said he is a huge fan of Banksy and only spray painted the noses red as ""a subtle change.""

He said: ""I am a huge fan of Banksy as I am also a graffiti artist and follow him on Instagram. When I saw the video I went straight over to Vyse Street to take a look.

""What annoyed me was the fact that the mural was all about homelessness but then lots of money was being spent on guarding the mural. Why not spend that money helping homeless people?

""It annoyed me so I went and got a tin of red spray paint. I had a picture taken on the bench and then I went and sprayed the reindeer's noses red.""

He said people begged him not to do it and there was 'screaming and shouting' when he sprayed the mural, adding: ""I don't regret doing it. I have quite enjoyed the debate which has been taking place since i did it.

""I just hope people will start concentrating more on the homeless issue now rather than who painted the reindeer noses red.""",newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (Katie Brooks),https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/banksy-raise-money-homeless-charities-17397574,"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 20:20:02 +0000",1576027202,1576024496,society,welfare

Briarwood Presbyterian Church, located near Birmingham, Alabama, and affiliated with the Presbyterian Church of America, was granted the authority to hire police in a bill that passed the state legislature and was signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey.

The 4,100-member church operates schools in Jefferson and Shelby counties that attract about 2,000 students. It also operates Madison Academy in Madison County, which has about 850 students.

The church and its schools “may appoint and employ one or more suitable persons to act as police officers to keep off intruders and prevent trespass upon and damage to the property … These persons shall be charged with all the duties and invested with all the powers of police officers, including the power of arrest for unlawful acts committed on the property,” the law states, according to Al.com.

The executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, Randall Marshall, said that the church could be allowed to hide criminal activity under this new law, The Associated Press reported.

TRENDING: Trump Gloats About the First Lady: ‘We Have Our Own Jackie O. Today… Melania T.’

He said the law will be challenged because it gives government power to a religious institution. The ACLU and other liberals vented their outrage about the law on Twitter, saying past allegations about the church should have stopped it from being able to have its own police.

The church has been seeking a police officer on its grounds for several years.

“Briarwood Presbyterian Church is very concerned with the safety of its members, students and visitors in these times of uncertainty when schools, churches, shopping malls and other places that do not have protection are randomly attacked,” Briarwood said in a 2017 news release on its website.

“We believe it is in the best interest of our members, students and visitors to provide the best protection possible for them with the least amount of intrusion upon their worship, school and other activities.”

At that time, the church addressed the issue of separating church and state.

“[I]t has been suggested to us that the state law permitting Briarwood Presbyterian Church to have a police officer on staff would violate the Establishment of Religion Clause in the U.S. Constitution. We are assured by counsel that this is not an Establishment Clause issue,” the church’s statement said.

“The church does not have the ability to exercise any authority or enforce any law at any place except on the church property and related to criminal acts which may take place on that property. Even then, arrests and other procedures that may follow are done in conjunction with local law enforcement and the District Attorney’s Office.”

A media release from Briarwood posted by WBRC in response to being given the go-ahead to hire police officers said the request stems from a 2016 state task force on the safety of educational institutions.

“The report recognized that the presence of qualified first responders and law enforcement officers has proven to be the number one line of defense in providing a safe environment, and recommended that each Alabama school have a resource officer on location,” the statement said.

A 2017 release also noted that the church does not put all of its trust in police officers.

“While seeking to be responsible, ultimately the church proclaims that its trust is in the Lord of Glory who sovereignly cares and provides for His people. To Him alone be Glory and Honor now and forevermore,” the release said.

In her opening statement in front of judges in The Hague on Wednesday, the former human rights icon rejected the case at the United Nations' highest court - which was filed by the Gambia with the support of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) - alleging Myanmar violated the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

The hearing concludes on Thursday, but a final judgement could take several years.
• Timeline: How the crackdown on Myanmar's Rohingya unfolded

Here is her speech in full:

""Thank you, Mr President and members of the court. It is an honour to appear as Agent of the Union of the Republic of Myanmar in these proceedings, in my capacity as Union Minister of Foreign Affairs.

""For materially less resourceful countries like Myanmar, the World Court is a vital refuge of international justice. We look to the Court to establish conditions conducive to respect for obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law, one of the fundamental objectives of the United Nations Charter.

""In the present case, Mr President, the Court has been asked to apply the 1948 Genocide Convention, one of the most fundamental multilateral treaties of our time. Invoking the 1948 Genocide Convention is a matter of utmost gravity. This is the treaty that we made following the systematic killing of more than six million European Jews, and that my country wholeheartedly signed as early as December 30, 1949, and ratified on March 14, 1956. Genocide is the crime that the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda applied in response to the mass-killing of perhaps 70 percent of the Tutsis in Rwanda. It is the crime that was not applied by the Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to the displacement of approximately one million residents of Kosovo in 1999. Neither was it applied by that Tribunal nor by this Court when deciding upon the exodus of the Serb population from Croatia in 1995.

""In both situations, international justice resisted the temptation to use this strongest of legal classifications because the requisite specific intent to physically destroy the targeted group in whole or in part was not present.

""Regrettably, The Gambia has placed before the Court an incomplete and misleading factual picture of the situation in Rakhine State in Myanmar. Yet, it is of the utmost importance that the Court assess the situation obtaining on the ground in Rakhine dispassionately and accurately. The situation in Rakhine is complex and not easy to fathom.

""But one thing surely touches all of us equally: the sufferings of the many innocent people whose lives were torn apart as a consequence of the armed conflicts of 2016 and 2017, in particular, those who have had to flee their homes and are now living in camps in Cox's Bazar.

""Mr President and members of the court, the troubles of Rakhine State and its population, whatever their background, go back into past centuries and have been particularly severe over the last few years. Currently, an internal armed conflict is going on there – between the Arakan Army, an organised Buddhist armed group with more than 5,000 fighters, and the regular Myanmar Defence Services. None of the speakers yesterday made any reference to this.

""The Arakan Army seeks autonomy or independence for Rakhine - or Arakan as it was called - finding inspiration in the memory of the historic Kingdom of Arakan. This conflict has led to the displacement of thousands of civilians in Rakhine. Standard security restrictions - such as curfew and checkpoints - are in place at present in the conflict zone and affect the situation of civilians there, regardless of their background.

""Mr President, on October 9, 2016, approximately 400 fighters of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army - known as ARSA – launched simultaneous attacks on three police posts in Maungdaw and Rathedaung townships in northern Rakhine, near the border with Bangladesh. ARSA claimed responsibility for these attacks, which led to the death of nine police officers, more than 100 dead or missing civilians, and the theft of 68 guns and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition.

""This was the start of an internal armed conflict between ARSA and Myanmar's Defence Services which lasted until late 2017. The selective factual propositions contained in The Gambia's Application actually concern this conflict.

""In the months following the October 9, 2016 attacks, ARSA grew in strength in the Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung townships in northern Rakhine. It resorted to threats and intimidation against local villagers in order to gain support and allegiance, executing suspected informers. According to, among others, the International Crisis Group, ARSA received weapons - and explosives - training from Afghan and Pakistani militants.

""In the early morning of August 25, 2017, several thousand ARSA fighters launched coordinated attacks on more than 30 police posts and villages, and an army base in northern Rakhine. Most of the attacks took place on the narrow Maungdaw plain, which is framed by densely forested hills to the east, and the border with Bangladesh to the west. Indications are that ARSA's objective was to seize Maungdaw township.

""It may aid the Court to briefly consider the historical significance of Maungdaw. When Britain made Burma a colonial entity separate from British India in 1937, the border between Burma and India was drawn along the river Naf, where we find today's border between Bangladesh and Myanmar. The historical Kingdom of Arakan had extended much further to the north than the river Naf, including most of what is today Chittagong District in Bangladesh.

""Members of some Rakhine communities, therefore, felt that the border drawn by the British was too far south; others, that it was too far north. Myanmar has never challenged this border since independence in 1948.

""Britain did not lose control over what is today Maungdaw township during World War II. From September 1942, a number of local Muslim families offered fighters to the British irregular V-Force set up to collect intelligence and to initially absorb any Japanese advance. Many Muslims gave their lives in combat against the Japanese in Rakhine.

""The sacrifices made by Muslim fighters motivated a call for the creation of an autonomous Muslim space in northern Rakhine, centred on Maungdaw. Whether or not this was encouraged by British officers, Britain rejected this call as soon as it had reoccupied Burma, before independence in 1948. The Muslim-Buddhist intercommunal violence of 1942 recurred in 1948 and several times after that. This cycle of violence has negatively affected life in northern Rakhine, making it the second poorest state in Myanmar.

""Mr President and members of the court, may I go back to the situation in Rakhine on the morning of August 25, 2017. More than thirty police stations and villages, and one military base, had been attacked before sunrise in a highly coordinated fashion, by an organised armed group operating along a densely forested hill-range that provides ample opportunity to hide. Many of the ARSA fighters had been recruited from local villages in the weeks and months preceding the attack.

""Myanmar's Defence Services responded to the attacks of ARSA fighters by the use of ground forces. There were armed incidents in more than 60 locations. The main clashes occurred in 12 places: In Min Gyi (Tola Toli) village, Chut Pyin village, Maung Nu village, Gutar Pyin village, Alai Than Kyaw village, Myin Lut village, Inn Din village, Chein Kharli (Koetan Kauk) village, Myo Thugyi ward, Kyauk Pandu village, wards of Maungdaw Town, and southern Maungdaw.

""Mr President, allow me to clarify the use of the term 'clearance operation' - 'nae myay shin lin yeh' in Myanmar [language]. Its meaning has been distorted. As early as the 1950s, this term has been used during military operations against the Burma Communist Party in Bago Range. Since then, the military has used this expression in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations after attacks by insurgents or terrorists. In the Myanmar language, 'nae myay shin lin yeh' – literally 'clearing of locality' – simply means to clear an area of insurgents or terrorists.

""It is still not easy to establish clear patterns of events in these 12 locations. Many ARSA fighters died. There may have been several hundred casualties in some of the 12 locations. There was some inter-communal violence. Buddhist and Hindu minority communities also feared for their security after the original ARSA attacks and many fled from their homes.

""It may be worth noting that the use of air power in military operations was avoided as far as possible to minimise the risk of collateral damage. However, in one incident, in order to be able to extract a unit surrounded by hundreds of ARSA fighters, the use of a helicopter was required. There was shooting from the helicopter which resulted in fatalities, which may have included noncombatants.

""Mr President, it cannot be ruled out that disproportionate force was used by members of the Defence Services in some cases in disregard of international humanitarian law, or that they did not distinguish clearly enough between ARSA fighters and civilians. There may also have been failures to prevent civilians from looting or destroying property after fighting or in abandoned villages. But these are determinations to be made in the due course of the criminal justice process, not by any individual in the Myanmar Government.

""Please bear in mind this complex situation and the challenge to sovereignty and security in our country when you are assessing the intent of those who attempted to deal with the rebellion. Surely, under the circumstances, genocidal intent cannot be the only hypothesis.

""Under its 2008 Constitution, Myanmar has a military justice system. Criminal cases against soldiers or officers for possible war crimes committed in Rakhine must be investigated and prosecuted by that system. On November 25, 2019, the Office of the Judge Advocate General announced the start of a court-martial for allegations linked to the Gutar Pyin village incident, one of the 12 main incidents referred to earlier. The Office also let it be known that there will be additional courts-martial if further incriminating evidence is brought by the Independent Commission of Enquiry. The ICOE is an independent special investigation procedure established for Rakhine allegations by the President of Myanmar, chaired by a former Deputy Foreign Minister from the Philippines, with three other members, including a former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations from Japan.

""On November 26, 2019, this Commission announced that it had taken about 1500 witness statements from all affected groups in Rakhine and that it has interviewed 29 military personnel who were deployed to the affected townships in northern Rakhine during the military operations from August 25, 2017, to September 5, 2017, as well as 20 police personnel who were stationed at the police posts that were attacked on August 25, 2017. There is currently no other fact-finding body in the world that has garnered relevant first-hand information on what occurred in Rakhine in 2017 to the same extent as the Independent Commission of Enquiry and the Office of the Judge Advocate General in Myanmar.

""This fact reinforces my sense that I should refrain from any action or statement that could undermine the integrity of these ongoing criminal justice processes in Myanmar. They must be allowed to run their course. It is never easy for armed forces to recognise self-interest in accountability for their members, and to implement a will to accountability through actual investigations and prosecutions. I respectfully invite the members of the court to consider for a moment the record of other countries. This is a common challenge, even in resource-rich countries.

""Recent cases in the news headlines illustrate that even when military justice works, there can be reversals. This can also happen in Myanmar. As part of the overall efforts of the Myanmar Government to provide justice, a court-martial found that 10 Muslim men had been summarily executed in Inn Din village, one of the 12 locations of serious incidents referred to earlier. It sentenced four officers and three soldiers each to ten years in prison with hard labour. After serving a part of their sentences, they were given a military pardon. Many of us in Myanmar were unhappy with this pardon.

""Other cases are undertaken without controversy. In the Mansi case, for example, a court-martial sat close to the location in Kachin State where three internally displaced civilians were killed. It sentenced six soldiers, each to 10 years in prison, in January 2018. Relatives of the victims and local civil society representatives were invited to the sentencing.

""The Office of the Judge Advocate General in Myanmar is by our standards well-resourced, with more than 90 staff and a presence in all regional commands throughout the country. I am encouraged by the Gutar Pyin court-martial, and I expect the Office to continue its investigations and prosecutions based on reliable evidence collected in Rakhine and from persons who witnessed what happened there.

""Can there be genocidal intent on the part of a state that actively investigates, prosecutes and punishes soldiers and officers who are accused of wrongdoing? Although the focus here is on members of the military, I can assure you that appropriate action will also be taken against civilian offenders, in line with due process. There will be no tolerance of human rights violations in the Rakhine, or elsewhere in Myanmar.

""Mr President, there are those who wish to externalise accountability for alleged war crimes committed in Rakhine, almost automatically, without proper reflection. Some of the United Nations human rights mandates relied upon in the Application presented by The Gambia have even suggested that there cannot be accountability through Myanmar's military justice system. This not only contradicts Article 20(b) of the Constitution of Myanmar, it undercuts painstaking domestic efforts relevant to the establishing of cooperation between the military and the civilian government in Myanmar, in the context of a Constitution that needs to be amended to complete the process of democratisation. That process is now underway at the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, the Union Parliament.

""The emerging system of international criminal justice rests on the principle of complementarity. Accountability through domestic criminal justice is the norm. Only if domestic accountability fails, may international justice come into play. It would be inconsistent with complementarity to require that domestic criminal justice should proceed much faster than international criminal justice. A rush to externalise accountability may undermine professionals in domestic criminal justice agencies. What does the appearance of competition between domestic and international accountability do to the public's trust in the intentions of impatient international actors?

""No stone should be left unturned to make domestic accountability work. It would not be helpful for the international legal order if the impression takes hold that only resource-rich countries can conduct adequate domestic investigations and prosecutions, and that the domestic justice of countries still striving to cope with the burden of unhappy legacies and present challenges is not good enough. The Gambia will also understand this challenge with which they too are confronted.

""Mr President and members of the court, these reflections are relevant to the present hearing because the Applicant has brought a case based on the Genocide Convention. We are, however, dealing with an internal armed conflict, started by coordinated and comprehensive attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, to which Myanmar's Defence Services responded. Tragically, this armed conflict led to the exodus of several hundred thousand Muslims from the three northernmost townships of Rakhine into Bangladesh – just as the armed conflict in Croatia with which the Court had to deal led to the massive exodus of, first, ethnic Croats and later, ethnic Serbs.

""As I have already stated, if war crimes have been committed by members of Myanmar's Defence Services, they will be prosecuted through our military justice system, in accordance with Myanmar's Constitution. It is a matter for the competent criminal justice authorities to assess whether, for example, there has been inadequate distinction between civilians and ARSA fighters, disproportionate use of force, violations of human rights, failure to prevent plundering or property destruction, or acts of forcible displacement of civilians. Such conduct, if proven, could be relevant under international humanitarian law or human rights conventions, but not under the 1948 Genocide Convention for reasons Professor William Schabas will elaborate in a moment.

""Mr President, allow me to share one further reflection in this Great Hall of Justice. International law may well be our only global value system, and international justice a practice that affirms our common values. Leaders of States and relevant inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations should also be cognisant of their responsibility to express and affirm fundamental values. Feeding the flames of an extreme polarisation in the context of Rakhine, for example, can harm the values of peace and harmony in Myanmar. Aggravating the wounds of conflict can undermine unity in Rakhine. Hate narratives are not simply confined to hate speech - language that contributes to extreme polarisation also amounts to hate narratives.

""Several international actors face a challenge here. But Myanmar could also have done more since the 1980s to emphasise the shared heritage and deeper layers of unity among the diverse peoples of our country. Cycles of inter-communal violence in Rakhine going back to the 1940s should be countered not just by practical measures aimed at sustainable development and rule of law, but also by nourishing a spiritual mindset of unity. It is a moral responsibility of leaders to guard the aspirations of people for harmony and peace.

""U Thant, the third United Nations Secretary-General, had understood this. He wrote in his memoirs View From the UN published in 1974: 'I even believe that the mark of the truly educated and imaginative person facing the twenty-first century is that he feels himself to be a planetary citizen' (p. 454). Encouraging this added layer of identity - a sense of planetary citizenship - is of fundamental importance for peaceful relations between nations as well as ethnic and religious groups.

""A commitment to broadening the mindset must go hand in hand with practical steps to improve lives. Even before the events of 2016-2017, Muslim, Buddhist and other communities in Rakhine faced what the Kofi Annan Advisory Commission described as complex challenges of low development and poverty rooted in enduring social conflict between the communities. The Myanmar government is committed to addressing these challenges. Together with our partners, we are now striving to ensure that all communities enjoy the same fundamental rights. To expedite citizenship verification and application, a mobile team is already in operation.

""All children born in Rakhine, regardless of religious background, are issued with birth certificates. Arrangements have been made to enable more Muslim youth to attend classes at universities across Myanmar. With the support of international and local partners, scholarships will also be made available to students from all communities living in Rakhine. The government has started a social cohesion model project in Maungdaw township, to promote social harmony among all communities. Inter-faith fora have been encouraged.

""These are some of the steps taken to improve livelihoods, security, access to education and health, citizenship, and social cohesion for all communities in Rakhine. Three IDP camps have already been closed, and an IDP-camp closure strategy has been adopted. Myanmar is also committed to voluntary, safe and dignified repatriation of displaced persons from Rakhine under the framework agreement reached between Bangladesh and Myanmar.

""Mr President, how can there be an ongoing genocide or genocidal intent when these concrete steps are being taken in Rakhine?

""To conclude, Mr President and members of the court, Rakhine today suffers an internal armed conflict between the Buddhist Arakan Army and Myanmar's Defence Services. Muslims are not a party to this conflict, but may, like other civilians in the conflict area, be affected by security measures that are in place. We pray the Court to refrain from taking any action that might aggravate the ongoing armed conflict and peace and security in Rakhine. Right now, in northern Rakhine, an army base near Paletwa is under attack by a group of more than 400 Arakan Army fighters, and some 200 insurgents have surrounded a military column near Ann City in Rakhine.

""Since Myanmar gained independence in 1948, our people have not known the security of sustainable development that is the fruit of peace and prosperity. Our greatest challenge is to address the roots of distrust and fear, prejudice and hate, that undermine the foundations of our Union. We shall adhere steadfastly to our commitment to non-violence, human rights, national reconciliation and rule of law, as we go forward to build the Democratic Federal Union to which our people have aspired for generations past.

""We look to justice as a champion of the reconciliation and harmony that will assure the security and rights of all peoples.

""Mr President and members of the court, I thank you for your kind attention and ask that you now call upon Professor William Schabas to continue the Myanmar submissions.""",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/transcript-aung-san-suu-kyi-speech-icj-full-191212085257384.html,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 09:32:12 GMT",1576161132,1576153340,politics,fundamental rights

The National Weather Service office in Oxnard allowed red flag warnings — which sound the alarm for strong winds, dry air and parched vegetation that can spread wildfires rapidly — to finally end at 6 p.m. Saturday.

Dangerous fire conditions had started at 11 p.m. Tuesday, causing forecasters to issue red flag warnings for L.A. and Ventura counties for 91 hours, an unusually long duration. Red flag warnings typically last only one or two days.

Gusts from Santa Ana winds, which come from the deserts of Nevada and Utah northeast of California and head southwest toward the coast starting in the autumn, are expected to fall to 20 mph to 30 mph, focused on only some mountain and interior valleys, said David Gomberg, meteorologist with the weather service’s Oxnard office.

“The speeds are not warranted to justify the red flag warning,” he said.

Still, the weather service expected elevated fire conditions through Sunday morning and perhaps brief moments of dangerous fire weather conditions.

Humidity levels were starting to improve, although it was still dry in interior areas such as the Santa Clarita Valley.

There’s a decent chance fog could return to the coast by Sunday night and Monday morning, Gomberg said.

There continues to be no rain on the horizon through mid-November, but also, no return of dangerous Santa Ana winds for at least four to five days, Gomberg said. At the moment, forecast models suggest some return of Santa Ana winds by Friday or Saturday, but “not nearly as strong as what we saw in the last few days.”

Some areas of L.A. and Orange counties reported brief, isolated showers Saturday as a weak low-pressure system brought up some tropical moisture, Gomberg said. There were a couple of rain-producing clouds in L.A. and Orange counties, but none in Ventura or Santa Barbara counties, he said.",Rong-Gong Lin II,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-02/elevated-fire-weather-conditions-through-sunday-morning-as-red-flag-warnings-expire,"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 01:25:26 -0500",1572762326,1573063842,weather,weather warning

The meeting will largely mirror a Situation Room briefing on border security Wednesday with the same eight members of leadership for both parties in the House and Senate. Friday's briefing will similarly take place in the Situation Room and is not expected to be open to press coverage.

The meeting also comes after the House and Senate adjourned Friday morning. The two chambers are set to return next Tuesday, all but assuring that the partial government shutdown will likely continue well into next week.

Fresh off her election as House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi is expected to pressure the president to sign a series of measures House Democrats passed Thursday evening that would open the six federal agencies shuttered in the government shutdown and extend Department of Homeland Security funding through Feb. 8 to make time for negotiations on border security.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would not bring the bills for a vote in his chamber without approval from the president, who has only dug in on his demands for more than $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

""The package presented by the House's new Democratic leaders yesterday can only be seen as a time-wasting act of political posturing,"" McConnell announced on the Senate floor Friday morning.

He went on: ""It does not carry the support of the president ... the president would actually veto it. And it cannot earn the support of 60 of my colleagues over here in the Senate. My friends across the aisle understand the ground rules perfectly well.""

But there were new signs of cracks in the GOP line as Republican members awaited word from the White House on what exactly the president might sign that would satisfy a sufficient number of Democrats to pass out of the Senate, where a 60-vote threshold is required.

Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, both said they would support measures that would end the partial shutdown and not provide the funding demanded by the president for his border wall.

Reacting to Gardner and Collins' statements, press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Friday the president wouldn't back down.

""Look the president has the support of the American people because they want to feel safe,"" Sanders said. ""The number one duty that the president has and frankly that Congress shares with him is to protect the people in this country.""

Both sides made no progress in the Wednesday meeting as President Trump and DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen sought to exclusively focus on the need for a wall, which Democrats have described as unnecessary and ""immoral"" in the broader argument for enhanced border security.","Alexander Mallin,

The World Weather Attribution Group (WWA) said that the mini-heatwave in Britain which saw temperatures reach 101F (38.7F) for the first time last week was made twice as likely by man-made global warming.

Researchers used long term temperature observations and climate models to look at how the weather would have unfolded with or without the human influence on the climate.

The researchers say the intensity of the heatwave was increased by between 1.5 and 3C across Europe and between 1.5 and 2.5C in Britain.

“Every European heatwave we and others have analysed was found to be made much more likely and more intense due to human-induced climate change, so it was not surprising that climate change played a role,” said Dr Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford and member of WWA.

“But how much more likely the heatwave is depends very strongly on the event definition: location, season, intensity and duration.

“This July 2019 heatwave was so extreme over continental Western Europe that the observed magnitudes would have been extremely unlikely without climate change.”",Sarah Knapton,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/08/02/climate-change-may-have-added-nearly-three-degrees-british-heatwave/,2019-08-02 13:46:36+00:00,1564767996,1567535019,environment,climate change
711946,theguardianuk--2019-10-11--HMV to open Europe's biggest entertainment store in Birmingham,2019-10-11,theguardianuk,HMV to open Europe's biggest entertainment store in Birmingham,"The biggest music and movies store in Europe opens on Friday as the new Canadian owner of HMV takes the first step in a bold expansion plan he hopes will defy slumping sales of CDs and DVDs.

The size of a supermarket and called HMV Vault, the Birmingham shop is stocking 80,000 CDs and 25,000 vinyl albums. It is a brave move at a time when traditional high-street retailers are closing in record numbers and in a business where online streaming has battered sales of physical entertainment products.

But it is a statement of intent by Doug Putman, the 35-year-old boss of Sunrise Records, which rescued 100 HMV stores from administration in February. He has pledged to invest at least £10m in reviving the chain and wants to make his shops part of local communities, work with charities and – in a sideswipe at Amazon – has promised to “pay our tax”.

UK sales of physical media, including CDs, DVDs and games, shrank by nearly 13% in the year to 25 August, according to market analysts Kantar. In video – mainly DVDs – sales plunged 28%.

HMV’s share of the market sank three percentage points to 14.4% in the three months to 30 June, compared with the same quarter in 2018. But HMV’s loss was Amazon’s gain, because the internet giant’s market share climbed by nearly the same amount and it now accounts for £1 out of every £4 spent on physical entertainment products.

As he puts the finishing touches to his new store, Putman is optimistic: “The market is definitely down but we are way ahead of the market. I’m really happy.” He said the chain had increased its movie sales despite the hefty downturn in the market.

The self-confessed vinyl nut, whose family owns Canadian toymaker and distributor Everest, has already re-opened 14 of the 28 HMV stores that closed after the retailer went into administration in December last year, taking the chain back to 114 outlets.

“I believe we can grow the chain,” he said. “A lot of high streets are challenged and struggling. The UK has got an amazing high street and we want to support that. There is something really special about it and when it’s gone, it’s gone.”

He said HMV had an advantage over Amazon because it offered an experience and was a part of local communities. “We hire people in communities and work with charities and we pay our tax. We do care. Amazon gives huge convenience but every time you get something amazing you are sacrificing something for that.”

“The world’s a scary place if there is just Amazon and ultimately we are all starting to realise that.”

The Birmingham store – underneath a carpark in a less salubrious part of the city centre shopping district – is aiming to offer something Amazon cannot. It has a stage to host bands and DJs and a screening room with space for 50 people alongside its music, film, books, band paraphernalia such as posters, T-shirts, mugs and technology such as headphones and turntables.

“We have more vinyl titles in stock in this store than sold in the whole of last year in the UK,” said Putman. “We need this to be a destination.”

The plan is to open a cafe, too – making it a destination entertainment store in the same way as Primark’s giant store down the road, which draws coachloads of shoppers with its cafes, beauty salon and barbers alongside cheap fashion.

Putman is also confident the UK chain can turn a profit in his first year. Moving out of HMV’s heavily loss-making Oxford Street store in London and agreeing rent cuts elsewhere have helped the bottom line, along with other savings.

“The market will contract but I don’t think HMV will. We will always beat the market,” he said.

“I’m really surprised how supportive customers and the public have been and how much people care and want us to succeed,” he added. “This is just the beginning; people will see more change coming in the next three to six months.”

The company has already achieved Putman’s aim of introducing more vinyl into its outlets. Each now stocks 3,000 to 7,000 albums, up from an average of just 500 before. Later this month, HMV will relaunch online, making it easier to search for and order items.

He is also giving more freedom to managers to stock goods they know will go down well locally. Stores are hosting local bands – and selling their CDs, vinyl or merchandise – and can pick up on regional trends, such as demand for reggae at the Birmingham Bullring store down the road.

Staff recommendations will also be an important part of the future. “We have got so much talent and knowledge in the teams. There are one million songs a month released on streaming services. How can anyone digest that? It’s up to us to say: ‘Here are the best 10 things which came out this week.’ We are trying to be the expert,” Putman said.",Sarah Butler,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/11/hmv-vault-europes-biggest-entertainment-store-birmingham,"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 05:00:46 GMT",1570784446,1570799635,"arts, culture, entertainment and media",arts and entertainment

Yellow warnings for wind and rain are in force across parts of the UK for the next four days, the Met Office said.

""Severe gales"" are expected later on today as Storm Gareth hits with gales predicted to reach up to 80mph and flooding expected in some areas.

In the last 12 hours, some areas have already seen nearly 5cm of rain with Capel Curig in Wales seeing 49mm.

There have also been speedy winds hurtling through regions in recent hours with winds already hitting 52mph in the south-west and worse expected.

Yellow warnings for wind cover most of England, Wales and Ireland until 3pm tomorrow. The Met Office issued a ""danger to life"" warning in Ireland.

""There is a small chance of injuries and danger to life from flying debris,"" forecasters said. They have also warned of power cuts and delays to bus and train journeys across the UK and Ireland.

A yellow warning for rain is in place in north-west England from just after midnight on Thursday to 10am on Friday.

The worst of the storm is expected this evening.

According to the Met Office, today's weather will see: ""Heavy rain across Wales and northern England, spreading southeastwards, with gusty winds.

""Brighter skies following from the north and later west, with heavy, blustery showers, wintry over northern hills. Turning very windy later, with severe gales in the northwest.""

However, tonight will see the worst of it and experts predict: ""Very windy with severe gales in the north. Heavy and squally showers across northern and central parts with risk of hail of thunder.""

There is a large weather warning for wind covering much of the UK today, with public transport liable to be affected.

In the north-west there is an added warning for rain, with ""flooding of a few homes and businesses likely"".

Speaking previously, Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: ""The strong north-westerly winds will also affect south-west Scotland late on Tuesday, spreading across much of England and Wales through Wednesday.

""Gusts of 50-55 mph are likely inland and up to 65 mph along western coasts. Winds will gradually ease during the afternoon.""

Gusts could even reach 80mph along northern coasts in coming days, with warnings in place through to Friday.

The storm has been caused by a deep area of low pressure and as well as the Met Office's warnings, the Environment Agency has also stated there is a risk of floods.

It has 29 flood alerts in place and four flood warnings, two in the south west and another pair in the north west.",Jacob Jarvis,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/storm-gareth-weather-latest-heavy-winds-and-rain-swoop-across-the-uk-with-safety-warnings-in-place-a4088986.html,2019-03-12 08:28:00+00:00,1552393680,1567546551,weather,weather forecast

Up to six inches of the white stuff is set to fall this weekend after the Met Office issued weather warnings for snow and ice across the UK today.

Injuries from slips and falls are expected on roads, pavements and cycle paths, as temperatures drop as low as -5C tonight.

Some parts of the country might see up to 15cm of snow settling as a low pressure system spreads.

Areas such as the Southern Uplands, Pennines, Cumbrian Fells, Peak District, the high ground of Northern Ireland, Snowdonia and the Cambrian Mountains, could see a light covering.

A forecast from Meteogroup said: ""It will be a damp start in the south-east, but rain will clear away to the east.

""Elsewhere, there will be a mixture of clear spells and scattered showers, some of which will be wintry, especially over high ground.

""Showers will turn increasingly to snow later across Scotland and northern England. Winds will be rather brisk.""

And the snow could keep coming down for as long as a week.

Richard Miles of the Met Office told The Sun Online: ""Where any precipitation falls there is a chance of it coming down as snow or sleet, especially in Scotland.

""So there's a possibility of snow on any of those days falling somewhere.""

On Thursday much of eastern parts of England and Scotland will see wintry showers and for many western areas it will be ""snow"" on Friday.

There could even be a chance of snow on the North York Moors and maybe a few flakes in Norfolk by Thursday morning, according to John Hammond, chief meteorologist for Weathertrending.

He added: ""By Friday, as a low pressure system spreads rain from the west, there’s a chance of it turning to snow over the Western Highlands, Cumbrian Fells and the Welsh Mountains.

""This cold spell is not directly related to the recent Alpine snow.

""Our cold snow is coming from the north, not the east.

""However, there are signs that later in the month and into February we may start to tap into some of that much colder Continental air.""

It comes after Continental Europe was hit by a ""once in 30 years"" big freeze as ten feet of snow brought chaos and at least 21 were killed.

The UK has dodged that Eastern chiller killer — but now a separate blast is on the way from the frozen Pole north of Iceland.

Wintry showers set to hit the North of England and Scotland from Wednesday to Friday could also sweep further south along with bitter gales.

The Weather Company even predicted a deep freeze of -17C some time after the weekend.

Brian Gaze, director and meteorologist for The Weather Outlook, told The Sun Online: ""The cold spell in Europe has been caused by an area of high pressure close to the UK blocking the flow of Atlantic weather systems into Europe.

""That pattern has opened the gates for very cold Arctic air to plunge southwards over much of the continent.

""During the coming days the UK will get a taste of the colder weather as the high pressure areas become centred further west in the Atlantic.

""In the longer term there is a chance of a more prolonged period of cold weather becoming established in the UK.""

338115,naturalnews--2019-12-24--Researchers look at the impact of medical foods in Alzheimer's patients,2019-12-24,naturalnews,Researchers look at the impact of medical foods in Alzheimer's patients,"(Natural News) The connection between diet and neurodegenerative diseases has long been the subject of scientific investigations. Today, although much remains to be understood, researchers and clinicians acknowledge the importance of diet in preventing, delaying, or improving the symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent cause of dementia around the world. This debilitating disease is still without a cure. Hence, scientists continue to search for viable treatments that can stop and reverse its progression.

In an article published in the journal Food Science and Human Wellness, researchers from China, Germany, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. reviewed dietary interventions used today for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. They also reviewed clinical studies and highlighted the importance of developing more reliable assessment tools to confirm the effects of medical foods and their role in the treatment of Alzheimer’s.

How diets and medical foods help in the treatment of Alzheimer’s

Despite advancements in modern medicine, treatments that can improve the symptoms of Alzheimer’s or delay — let alone prevent — its progression have not yet been developed. Today, treatment relies heavily on conventional medications, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) or NMDA receptor antagonists like memantine. According to studies, these medications have little to no effect on cognitive impairment and cause unwanted side effects like headaches, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.

Mother Nature's micronutrient secret: Organic Broccoli Sprout Capsules now available, delivering 280mg of high-density nutrition, including the extraordinary ""sulforaphane"" and ""glucosinolate"" nutrients found only in cruciferous healing foods. Every lot laboratory tested. See availability here.

Studies have also reported that some risk factors associated with dementia have something to do with diet. In addition, dietary components have been shown to influence brain activity and cognitive function. In recent years, more attention has been focused on exploring the potential of dietary interventions to improve Alzheimer’s symptoms. So far, researchers have explored the effects of the Mediterranean diet, ketogenic diets, and so-called medical foods on Alzheimer’s patients. (Related: Most cases of Alzheimer’s are preventable: New book explains how.)

The effects of the Mediterranean diet

The Mediterranean diet promotes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, seeds, nuts, and olive oil, and encourages the avoidance of red meat and processed foods. Epidemiological studies and clinical trials suggest that this type of diet improves cognitive performance and lowers the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.

Researchers attribute the neuroprotective effects of the Mediterranean diet on phytonutrients like flavonols, carotenoids, and sulfur compounds, as well as omega fatty acids, which help fight inflammation. Inflammation in the brain activates immune cells called microglia, and this activation has been linked to the development of Alzheimer’s.

Another characteristic of Alzheimer’s is a decrease in glucose utilization, particularly in the brain. Normally, the body produces alternative energy sources called ketone bodies when it is deprived of glucose. Scientists have discovered that while glucose metabolism is impaired in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, utilization of ketone bodies is unaffected. Hence, supplementing the brain with ketone bodies seems like a logical and promising treatment strategy.

Ketogenic diets involve the consumption of foods rich in fat, while carbohydrate intake is reduced or eliminated. This carbohydrate restriction robs the body of glucose and forces it to produce ketone bodies. Both animal and human studies have reported significant improvements in cognitive outcomes for subjects on ketogenic diets. Even older adults with age-related cognitive decline have been shown to benefit from this type of diet.

Medical foods were developed for the purpose of helping patients, especially those with metabolic diseases, meet specific dietary requirements. In the U.S., these foods have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use. So far, researchers have identified three medical foods that can improve Alzheimer’s symptoms. These medical foods are Axona, Souvenaid, and CerefolinNAC.

Axona consists of caprylic triglycerides, which can be obtained from coconut or palm oils, albeit in small quantities. Caprylic triglycerides are meant to serve as precursors for ketone bodies. Souvenaid is a drink that’s composed of a variety of nutrients, including phosphatide precursors, which could improve synaptic function. Synaptic dysfunction is a major cause of cognitive impairment.

CerefolinNAC, meanwhile, is a special formulation containing N-acetyl-cysteine, the supplement form of the amino acid homocysteine used to address hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia lowers cognitive performance and is said to cause brain atrophy.

Although these medical foods have shown positive results in preliminary studies, the researchers believe that large-scale clinical studies involving the use of valid, sensitive, and reliable assessment tools are necessary to establish the efficacy of medical foods in treating Alzheimer’s disease.",Evangelyn Rodriguez,http://www.naturalnews.com/2019-12-24-impact-of-medical-foods-in-alzheimers-patients.html,"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 18:32:49 +0000",1577230369,1577276026,science and technology,scientific research

Moscow and St. Petersburg are becoming more affordable for expats, according to new rankings from a global consulting firm.

“Despite moderate price increases in most of the European cities, European currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, which pushed most cities down in the ranking,” said Yvonne Traber, Mercer’s global mobility product solutions leader.

“Additionally, other factors like recent security issues and concern about the economic outlook have impacted the region,” she said.

Mercer creates its rankings by comparing the costs of more than 200 items including housing, transportation, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. New York City is used as the base for all comparisons, and currency movements are measured against the U.S. dollar.

Hong Kong remained the most expensive city for expats, according to Mercer’s ranking, followed by Tokyo and Singapore. Karachi, Tashkent and Tunis were named the cheapest, while Ashgabat catapulted 36 spots to rank the world’s seventh-most expensive city for expats.

At fifth place, Zurich was the only European city to crack the consultancy firm’s top 10 in prices for expats.

Al Adeini lost his wife and children in the attack and later died after succumbing to his injuries at the al Thwarah General Hospital.

Al Adeini is among at least 77 civilians — including women and children, as well as two Russian citizens — who were killed or injured in a wave of Saudi-led Coalition airstrikes on various neighborhoods of Yemen’s capital, Sana`a on early Thursday. Dozens of civilians also sustained injuries in the attacks. The son of Abdullah Sabri, the president of the Union of Yemeni Journalists, was also among the dead. The Sabri home was destroyed in the attack.

The airstrikes that targeted the home of al Ahmed Sharf al Adeini killed his entire family, including four children. The six bodies of the al Adeini family were retrieved from the rubble — a soon-to-die father, his children and his wife, all buried together. Three mentally disabled people were also reportedly killed in the attack, including a child and his father as they walked through a populated residential neighborhood that was targeted.

The airstrikes leveled parts of one neighborhood in which seven more homes were destroyed, forcing families to flee in their pajamas. “We were asleep; it was 8 a.m. when a large explosion woke us up. Airstrikes bombed our neighbor,” a local resident told MintPress.

Under dim lights and amid panicked screams, rescuers struggled to retrieve bodies from the rubble. MintPress cameras documented the rescue efforts while bystanders filmed on their phones as a victim was being pulled out from under the rubble. “So far we’ve recovered more than 10 [bodies] including four disabled people and the family of al Adeini, all of them dead,” a local resident assisting in the rescue efforts told MintPress, drenched in sweat and wearing only his underwear.

The Ministry of Public Health and Population announced in a statement on Thursday that the number of casualtiesl had risen to 77, victims of the Saudi attacks on the Raqas residential neighborhood. “After operations to recover victims and wounded from the rubble was complete, 77 were counted among the killed and wounded,” Dr. Yousef al Hadheri, spokesman of the Ministry of Health, told MintPress.

The death toll could rise due to the intensity of the strikes and the number of those who have been seriously injured, while other civilians, dead or wounded, are still trapped under the rubble.

The situation for Yemen’s healthcare sector is especially dire given that the Coalition’s blockade of Yemen has prevented medicine and other critical commodities from reaching around 8.4 million people, many of whom are believed to be on the verge of starvation.

The attacks have enraged local residents, who took to the streets of Raqas to condemn the airstrikes and loss of civilian life, calling for counter-attacks on Coalition forces. Most here hold the United States responsible for the attacks, as the U.S. supplies Saudi Arabia with advanced weapons as well as logistical and intelligence assistance.

Saudi warplanes also struck a building housing Yemen’s Ministry of Information and more than 20 airstrikes struck targets in civilian areas across Sana`a on Thursday morning.

The official spokesman of Ansar Allah, the political wing of the Houthis, called the airstrikes in Sana`a a crime, and proof of the military and political failure of the Saudi forces.

The Saudi-led Coalition confirmed that its warplanes carried out airstrikes in Sana`a on Thursday. “We have begun to launch airstrikes targeting sites operated by the Houthis militia, including in Sana`a,” a Coalition official, who declined to be identified, told AFP.  So far the United States has not commented on the airstrikes.

Immigration policies put in place following an agreement between Mexico and the Trump Administration broke up a caravan consisting of approximately 2,000 people from Central America, Africa, and the Caribbean Islands, the Associated Press reported Saturday. The group began to move northward from Tapachula, Chiapas, early one morning last week after being held up for official travel documents. The group quickly encountered Mexican Federal Police and members of the newly formed National Guard.

When the group came upon the police and soldiers, some scattered while others surrendered.

The migrants are provided opportunities to request asylum in Mexico. Instead, the group chose to illegally attempt to move through Mexico to the U.S. border.

“I want to pass through Mexico, I don’t want to live here,” Amado Ramirez expressed. Reportedly traveling with his wife and young children, he said he hoped to obtain documents allowing him to pass through Mexico.

Hundreds of African migrants also attempted to make their way through Mexico but the government stalled their request for visas. “Almost all of them want to seek asylum in the United States, rather than stay in Mexico,” the AP reported.

Stressful conditions turned violent as some of the migrants “engaged in scuffles” with police at the regional immigration office.

Under the agreement between Mexico and the United States, Mexican immigration officials give the migrants two choices — stay in Mexico or leave via Mexico’s southern border. Many are flown back to their countries of origin. African migrants have a more difficult path as their home countries often lack the infrastructure to handle mass repatriations, the AP stated.

Migrant support groups reported that the presence of the National Guard and other law enforcement officials in southern Mexico made the process for moving north very difficult.

Large group migration through Mexico to the U.S. southern border hit a 12-year high during Fiscal Year 2019. However, changes in Mexican policies negotiated by the Trump Administration effectively dropped the numbers from a high mark of nearly 133,000 in May to about 40,000 in September, Breitbart Texas reported. By the end of the fiscal year, U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended an estimated 850,000.

Arsenal are exploring the possibility of making former midfielder Edu the club’s new director of football.

The Gunners are keen to add further expertise to their first-team operations as part of a restructuring which began when Arsene Wenger was in charge and continued this season with chief executive Ivan Gazidis’s departure to AC Milan.

Barcelona are reluctant to let Arsenal target Denis Suarez leave on loan this month ahead of a proposed permanent move in the summer, according to the Mirror.

Lazio have had a £13million bid for Chelsea full-back Davide Zappacosta accepted, according to The Sun.

Chelsea want £10million for Cesc Fabregas as the midfielder flies south for talks following his farewell performance at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, report the Mirror.

Manchester United face a battle with Liverpool and Real Madrid for Porto right-back Eder Militao, according to The Sun.

Meanwhile, The Sun reports Fulham goalkeeper Fabri is set to return to Besiktas just six months after leaving the club to move to west London.

And Frank Lampard has given up hope of signing Chelsea teenager Ethan Ampadu on loan.

Chelsea will make a £50m bid to try and sign PSG striker Edinson Cavani to solve their woes up front.

The Sunday Express report Maurizio Sarri wants the Uruguay international to lead his attack with Alvaro Morata and Olivier Giroud failing to fulfil that role under the Italian.

Arsenal meanwhile have opened talks with Barcelona over a move for Spanish midfielder Denis Suarez. The Guardian claim the Spaniard is available for around £20m with Unai Emery keen to bring in a player he has previously worked with at Sevilla.

Fulham will offer £15m for Liverpool forward Divock Origi to help their Premier League survival bid, according to the Mirror.

But after offloading Dominic Solanke to Bournemouth, Jurgen Klopp may be wary of letting another backup forward leave the club ahead of their title run in.

Chelsea are said to be close to sealing a complicated loan agreement which will bring Gonzalo Higuain to Stamford Bridge.

Sky Sports say Tottenham and Man City are on alert after young Sunderland striker Josh Maja rejected a new contract with the Black Cats.

An emergency response group from the Nakhodka port in the Primorsky Region has ended a search operation for a lost sailor following an explosion onboard the Zaliv Amerika tanker, but the vessel’s owner, Nayada, will continue the search, a company representative told TASS on Wednesday.

""Nakhodka’s rescuers terminated the search operation, but the company will carry on the effort, at least until November 12. Work resumed this morning, and there are plans to use surface equipment. The examination of the coastline is continuing,"" the official said. The port’s emergency response group confirmed to TASS that the search operation was over.

According to the Federal Agency for Maritime and River Transport, the seabed under the explosion site remained unexplored until Tuesday morning due to violent, powerful winds and two-meter-high waves. On Tuesday, a group of divers searched the area with the use of a deep submergence vehicle. Almost 9,000 square meters of the water area, 1.5 km of coastline, and 22,500 square meters under the water were examined.

On the morning of November 2, the maritime rescue and coordination center in Vladivostok received a report about a blast onboard a tanker that was located in Nakhodka Bay near the Astafyev Cape. According to investigators, a gas-air mixture exploded. Two of the vessel’s 12 crewmembers were killed. They were identified as the first mate and a sailor.

The vessel’s owner, Nayada, promised to pay 1 million rubles ($15,617) to each bereaved family and cover the expenses for the funerals.

But what activities take place and what is Tomb-Sweeping Day all about?

Chinese New Year is on February 5, 2019 - TODAY- with celebrations lasting for two weeks.

Many of the decorations – which typically include lanterns and paintings - feature the colour red as it is a symbol of good luck in Chinese culture.

Revellers wear traditional Chinese clothing such as colourful silks to represent joy and good fortune.

Many people visit Chinese temples to pray for good luck and burn incense sticks, before heading off to enjoy lavish firework shows that are thought to scare off bad spirits.

Parades are popular, with families flocking to watch costumed dancers dressed as dragons and lions.

People often give red envelopes of money to friends and family during the period, and some like to offer food and drink to their ancestors.

Feasting plays a central part of the festivities and many people will eat traditional food and make dumplings to enjoy.

On the final day of Chinese New Year, large decorative lanterns are used to celebrate the Lantern Festival.

Tomb-Sweeping Day, also known as the Qingming Festival, is a day to celebrate life and honour the dead.

It is held early April each year and this year falls on Thursday, April 5.

On the day, people will go and visit their ancestors’ graves and offer food and burn incense to commemorate them.

You may even see people burning paper money as an offering to the dead so the deceased can buy what they wish in the afterlife.

One of the most popular activities is to fly a kite with lanterns attached to the end.",rpemberton,https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/5363237/chinese-new-year-2019-traditions-tomb-sweeping-day/,2019-02-05 07:51:54+00:00,1549371114,1567549569,"arts, culture, entertainment and media",culture

If you’re pining for a few days of proper warmth, have a look at some of these holiday ideas. For skiers, it’s also the time for a last blast of snow in the mountains.

But if you want to get ahead on your summer holidays and plan to go away in July, here are some ideas that might inspire you too.

Snow is still smothering the Alps, and you can take advantage of the longer days with a ski holiday staying at Chalet Charlie in Morzine, in the vast Portes du Soleil area. Sleeping 12, the smartly furnished accommodation is close to the Pleney ski lifts and has a hot tub on the sun deck. Alpine Elements has a week’s catered holiday for a family of four from £2,100, departing 7 April. The price includes flights, transfers, breakfast, afternoon tea and five dinners with wine. There’s also a deal with lift passes, offering a free child’s pass when you buy an adult one.

Get away for the Easter holidays, preferably to the depths of the Cornish countryside. Holiday Cottages has four nights’ availability at Sowanna Farm Cottage, near Mullion Cove on the Lizard peninsula. The two-bedroom cottage is in the wing of a stone farmhouse surrounded by farmland, and there’s also a games room if the weather turns rough. Four nights from 18 April cost £401.

With spring flowers smothering the Turkish countryside in colour and fragrance, April is an appealing time for a laid-back holiday exploring the peaceful landscapes south of the port of Fethiye. Hole up in the hamlet of Faralya, near Butterfly Valley, where Cachet Travel has availability in the delightful Mandarin & Mango Boutique Hotels. A week’s half-board costs from £882pp, departing 23 April, and includes flights and transfers.

It’s the dry season in Koh Samui in April, with temperatures comfortably in the mid-20Cs. On the island’s quieter north coast is the zen-like Zazen Boutique Resort, where the tropical gardens lead straight to a white sandy beach. Tropical Sky has a week’s B&B at this chic, chilled-out hotel from £1,069pp, including flights and transfers, departing 29 April.

Move quickly to snap up Chiesa Amaro, a former church that’s been converted into a stylish villa deep in the countryside of the Marche region. The exquisite town of Urbino is less than an hour’s drive away, and Adriatic beaches are roughly the same distance. Oliver’s Travels has a week’s rental in this attractive two-bedroom villa, which includes a pool, barbecue and sublime views, for £1,295 from 6 July.

While the Mediterranean resorts swelter in the summer heat, escape to the freshness of the Austrian Alps. Better still, do it on two wheels as you get to know the lake region of Salzkammergut. Headwater offers a self-guided cycling tour that’s a relatively gentle way of exploring lakes and rivers, including the Mondsee and the River Ischl. Six nights throughout July cost from £1,159pp, including B&B accommodation in four-star hotels, four dinners, transfers, bikes, GPS and luggage transfers. Flights are extra but can be arranged.

Be mesmerised by the midnight sun as you take one of the most spectacular railway journeys in Europe. Nordic Experience has a four-night “Across the Roof of Norway” holiday that starts in Oslo before taking you on the Bergensbanen 12-hour train to Bergen alongside magnificent fjords. The starting price of £995pp includes flights, transfers, breakfast and dinners, for departures throughout July.

5911,activistpost--2019-11-06--We Haven’t Seen A Manufacturing Slowdown Like This Since The Last Financial Crisis,2019-11-06,activistpost,We Haven’t Seen A Manufacturing Slowdown Like This Since The Last Financial Crisis,"This isn’t what was supposed to happen. According to the economic optimists, there was going to be a great “manufacturing renaissance” as America entered a wonderful new golden age of boundless prosperity. But of course that is not what has happened.

Manufacturing activity has been declining for the past three months, and all across the country we are seeing economic conditions rapidly deteriorate. Over and over, we are seeing economic numbers that are worse than anything we have seen since the last recession, but the economic optimists keep assuring us that these are just temporary blips on the way to America’s glorious economic renewal. Well, they can keep believing in a mirage of future prosperity if they want, but the hard numbers keep telling us another story. For example, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index has now fallen to a level that was “last sustained during the financial crisis”…

In the middle of the country, it already feels like a manufacturing recession for many business owners. Manufacturing facilities are being closed down, machines are being idled and thousands of workers are being let go. The following comes from a CNBC article about our current manufacturing slowdown…

That sure doesn’t sound like a “booming economy” to me.

So far this year, thousands upon thousands of manufacturing workers have been laid off in the Upper Midwest. By now, we were supposed to be adding large numbers of these good paying jobs, but instead we are losing them at a frightening pace.

In fact, it is being reported that more than 8,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in the key state of Pennsylvania alone…

Of course it isn’t just the manufacturing industry where employment is cooling off. At this point, the number of job openings in the U.S. has fallen to an 18 month low, and it is expected to fall ever further in the months ahead.

Things have already gotten so bad that the mainstream media is running articles about how ordinary Americans can prepare for the coming recession. For instance, the following comes from a CNN article entitled “What can you do now to financially prepare for a layoff later?”…

And remember, all of this is happening even though the federal government is running trillion dollar deficits and the Federal Reserve is using up all the ammunition that they should be saving for the depths of the next recession.

In essence, the authorities are already implementing emergency measures in a desperate attempt to support the faltering U.S. economy, but it isn’t working.

This week, we learned that orders for Class-8 trucks in the month of October were down 51 percent from a year ago.

Can anyone explain to me how that is consistent with the “booming economy” narrative that the economic optimists are endlessly pushing?

Unfortunately, the truth is that we can see signs of a major slowdown all around us. U.S. business hiring has fallen to a 7 year low, the Cass Freight Index has declined for 10 months in a row, and manufacturing is now the smallest share of the United States economy that it has been in 72 years.

But despite all of the evidence that is staring them right in the face, the economic optimists continue to insist that everything is probably going to be okay. In fact, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon is telling us that “the chance of a U.S. recession between now and the election is small”…

Of course the truth is that American consumers are actually not “very healthy” at this moment. Consumer confidence has fallen for 3 months in a row, and 44 percent of all Americans currently do not make enough money to cover their monthly expenses.",Activist Post,https://www.activistpost.com/2019/11/we-havent-seen-a-manufacturing-slowdown-like-this-since-the-last-financial-crisis.html,"Wed, 06 Nov 2019 17:36:20 +0000",1573079780,1573062425,"economy, business and finance",economic sector
711965,theguardianuk--2019-10-11--Last wolves in Africa: the fragile wildlife of Ethiopia's ravaged parks | Tom Gardner,2019-10-11,theguardianuk,Last wolves in Africa: the fragile wildlife of Ethiopia's ravaged parks | Tom Gardner,"Conservationist Getachew Assefa points across the valley. “It started close to the mist over there, by the most spectacular viewpoint,” he says. “Almost all the grassland was burnt. All of that plateau and the steep cliff over there.”

Six months after wildfires torched this part of Ethiopia’s Simien Mountains, the scars are healing: heather and grass have returned to carpet the hilltop, brightened by the yellow daisies which bloom after the long rains. On the near side of the valley lie barley fields, rippling in the wind.

The scene is bucolic. But, as Assefa explains, these montane grasslands and the rare wildlife they host are under threat.

Two fires broke out earlier this year, ravaging one of the oldest natural Unesco world heritage sites, and destroying, at least temporarily, the habitat of some of the world’s rarest species: the copper-coated Ethiopian wolf and the walia ibex, a goat found nowhere else on earth.

Few doubt the blazes’ cause. The park’s wolf monitors – which include Assefa – saw, through binoculars, two men setting tussocks alight, though they couldn’t confirm their identities.

“They did it in five areas, on purpose,” he says. The fire raged for several days, and it took thousands of locals including a nearby football club – eventually assisted by a team of Israeli firefighters – to bring the flames under control. Around the same time the Bale Mountains, in the country’s south, were also affected by wildfires that lasted for more than 20 days and which experts attributed to human encroachment on the park.

Incidents like these shed light on the pressures threatening Ethiopia’s fragile wildlife and delicate ecosystems: accelerating competition over resources as the human population swells, political instability, global heating and mass tourism.

“We are in a crisis situation,” says Greta Iori, Ethiopia technical advisor for the Wildlife Conservation Society, who fears the country’s endemic species are being driven close to extinction. “We are inundated with issues when it comes to wildlife.”

Ethiopia was one of the first countries in Africa to establish national parks. The Simien Mountains were formally added to these in 1969, and today there are 20 national parks, and many more protected areas nationwide. For a country with few minerals or natural resources such as oil, assets like these are an important source of national income.According to the World Bank, “natural capital”, including forests and agricultural land, accounts for 40% of Ethiopia’s total wealth.

But the parks are in a dire state. In Omo national park, in the far south of Ethiopia near the border with Kenya, the government is building sugar factories and vast irrigated plantations. Awash national park, the country’s oldest, is severed in two by the railway and eastern highway towards Djibouti. Abijatta-Shalla, south of Addis Ababa, is home to a soda ash factory.

Meanwhile, ethnic unrest in eastern Ethiopia has had an enormous impact on Babile Elephant Sanctuary, one of the country’s most important elephant ranges. According to Iori a huge number of new human settlements have appeared inside its borders since 2017.

The elephant population is under extreme pressure due to “heightened and unavoidable human-elephant conflict”, she says. A population of about 500 could be decimated “in a blink of an eye” through poaching, with park staff struggling to secure the sanctuary.

“2019 has been brutal with an incredible spike in elephant killings,” she says. “It’s like we’ve already lost in Babile, and it’s heartbreaking.”

Nationwide, conservation efforts have been stymied in recent years by civil unrest and the political transition following the appointment of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in 2018.

“In general Ethiopia has never been a huge poaching-for-trafficking hotspot – but since law and order has crumbled we’ve seen a spike in opportunistic poaching and subsequent trafficking,” Iori says. “The police and army are busy with other things, and the risk of getting caught is low.”

In the Simien Mountains the problems are less advanced and the park better managed. But similar dynamics are present. When political protests broke out in 2016, the park was a target of popular anger, with locals breaking prohibitions against tree-chopping and livestock grazing. “Everyone was rushing to get his share,” recalls Assefa. “We lost two of the best wolf habitats.”

Today the park’s authorities still struggle to enforce local laws designed to protect the natural environment.

“There is a big conflict between the young, unemployed people and the park management,” Assefa explains. He reckons the fires this year were started by locals disgruntled by the authorities’ heightened clampdown on livestock grazing inside the park’s perimeters.

Setegn, a local farmer whose house lies just beyond the park, admits he grazes his animals inside the boundary marked by the main road. “The park management said we can’t cross the road – they say we won’t get any benefit from tourism unless we graze on the right-hand side,” he says. “But it’s very difficult. There is no survival for us without livestock.”

Others interviewed by the Guardian expressed the same concerns, saying their incomes had been badly hit by the restrictions.

The barley fields on the left of the road are another sign of human intrusion, and of the waning authority of the park management, notes Nick Crane, the British owner of Simien Mountain Lodge. “They encroach slowly – imperceptibly – so you hardly notice it,” he says.

According to Abebaw Azanaw, the park warden, there are about 130 households around the edges of the park.

Relocating them would be costly and could spark renewed conflict. In 2016 the entire village of Gichi – nearly 500 households located on the escarpment where the fire started – opted to move to a new settlement near the town of Debark, which cost the government on average $17,000 (£14,000) per family. The compensation was sizeable but many complained about a lack of electricity in their new homes on arrival, and of a lack of jobs. Some threatened to return to the park.

“We learnt from Gichi that it is very difficult to resettle people from the park,” says Assefa.

The root of the problem is common in many developing countries when it comes to conservation: how to strike the right balance between the resource demands of local residents and the need to protect the natural environment for future generations.

Promoting tourism is part of the answer, should it mean jobs and higher incomes for locals, but only if managed well.

In 2015 the Ethiopian Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced that it intended to triple foreign visitors to more than 2.5 million by 2020.

But for John Watkin, who worked in the Simien Mountains as the chief technical advisor for Africa Wildlife Foundation between 2018 and 2019, “uncontrolled tourism” is the most serious threat to the park’s wildlife.

“The park infrastructure is simply not set up for huge numbers of tourists … Tourism is always looking for a new hot destination, and Ethiopia is it. But unless it is done well it is going to cause serious problems,” he says.

For Crane, one answer is to increase the park price for foreign visitors, to try to limit the number coming to the Simien Mountains each year.

Meanwhile Watkin suggests Ethiopia considers alternative conservation approaches that allow communities to take ownership of the process, moving away from the state-led “fortress conservation” model that prevails. He notes examples in Kenya and Tanzania, where local communities run eco-lodges and tourism ventures while ensuring the landscape is protected. “They’re 20 to 30 years ahead of Ethiopia in this,” he says.

Such approaches might make it possible for Ethiopia to square the circle between conservation and development.

“The core of the problem is that tourism is not working for the locals,” says Joshua Amlakse, a Simien Mountains guide. “Nothing ends up in the local community.”",Tom Gardner in Debark,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/last-wolves-in-africa-fragile-wildlife-ethiopia-park,"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 06:00:07 GMT",1570788007,1570799706,environment,conservation

Severe thunderstorm warnings are in place for London and the south east on Monday, with the chance of flooding, travel disruption and power cuts, the Met Office warns.

Further north, a yellow weather warning will be in place overnight from Chester to Lancaster, as forecasters warn of heavy rain and further flood risks.

Regular heavy downpours could continue into the last week of the month - with potentially enough rainfall to make it the wettest August on record.

The previous high, in 1912, saw an average of 167.6mm across the country.

Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell said: “It’s been pretty wet and it looks like it’s going to stay that way until the last week of August. Only then are we expecting to see a break in the clouds.”

Fellow meteorologist Bonnie Diamond said: ""This week there's going to be a fresher feel, winds from the north bringing cooler temperatures than we've seen in a while.

""It's going to be an unsettled week with periods of low pressure bringing rain and wind at times, especially on Wednesday and Friday. We're looking at top temperatures in the high teens.""

Monday's yellow weather warning, stretching from the English Channel, westwards towards Portsmouth and north over Essex, brings the possibility of localised flooding and travel disruption.

Ms Diamond added: ""There's the possibility of up to 40-60mm of rain in just a couple of hours in some places. That's some pretty heavy downpours.""

After a more settled day on Tuesday, the wet and windy weather will then return midweek, with more widespread showers across the UK.

Ms Diamond explained: ""Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, an area of low pressure is bringing a band of rain across the whole country.

""Wednesday is going to be a pretty wet day.""

The bleak outlook follows a weekend of unseasonable heavy rain and 60mph gales, in which some parts of the country saw as much rain in 48 hours as they typically get over the whole month of August.

More than 70mm of rain fell in Cumbria on Saturday, with the RAF station of Spadeadam being the worst hit.

The Met Office said 71.4mm fell at the facility on Saturday - compared to a monthly average of 82.4mm for August in the region.

Train lines were blocked by flooding between Cumbria and Scotland and between Blackburn and Clitheroe, as travellers across the UK were hit by delays and disruption.

Elsewhere, ferry passengers heading into Dover faced delays of five hours as tug boats battled the weather to guide them into port.

The Environment Agency issued three flood warnings on Sunday night urging “immediate action” and 20 “be prepared” flood alerts across the North of England",Harriet Brewis,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-weather-latest-downpours-set-to-last-until-end-of-august-a4211371.html,2019-08-12 11:18:00+00:00,1565623080,1567534340,weather,weather statistic

432688,prisonplanet--2019-09-12--The Signs Of A Slowing Job Market Are Visible And Many,2019-09-12,prisonplanet,The Signs Of A Slowing Job Market Are Visible And Many,"Signs that the job market is slowing have been piling up this week. One of the “brightest” and most touted pieces of the American economy is showing cracks, and many are taking notice.

It took a little time, but United States businesses have warned over the past year that the effects of tariffs would ripple into the labor market.  We continued to warn that the effects of this trade war on the American worker and consumer would be felt heavily, while the nation of China is left largely unscathed. But until now, it appears that not many have listened.

According to Business Insider, the Labor Department on Tuesday said the number of job openings fell by 31,000 in July to a seasonally adjusted 7.2 million, the latest sign of weakening labor demand. The results showed openings remained plentiful, but they came just days after the department reported weaker-than-expected figures for August employment.

“Last week’s jobs report sparked a debate over whether the slowdown in hiring is due to an economy hitting full employment, but today’s JOLTS report indicates that this is actually a labor market that is losing momentum,” said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab.

The US added 130,000 nonfarm payrolls in August, a slowdown from a month earlier and compared with forecasts for an addition of 160,000. Economists said the real increase was closer to 105,000 last month, however, without taking into account a wave of temporary workers hired for the 2020 census. Earlier Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business said small firms reported fewer open positions that they could not fill in August as outlooks for the economy dimmed.

“The good news — relatively — is that capex plans rose a point, though the trend remains weak and continues to signal a clear downshift in business investment through the end of this year and into early 2020,” said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics according to Business Insider.

The downturn in the economy has been obvious for a little while, and Trump’s trade war is shaking things up in the wrong way. A majority of Americans think a recession will hit the U.S. next year, and most are blaming Trump for starting an economically devastating trade war.

560766,tass--2019-02-01--Siberian scientists wrap up Ebola vaccine trials,2019-02-01,tass,Siberian scientists wrap up Ebola vaccine trials,"NOVOSIBIRSK, February 1. /TASS/. Specialists at the Novosibirsk State Research
Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR have completed trials of a vaccine
against the Ebola virus disease, which claimed the lives of over 11,000 people
in Africa recently, said Nikolai Krasnikov, Head of the Administration of
Koltsovo Science City near Novosibirsk where the research center is located,
at the TASS press center on Friday.

""Our scientists have wrapped up clinical trials of the Ebola vaccine this
year. Now it is ready for use,"" he announced.

The World Health Organization describes the Ebola virus disease (EVD, formerly
known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever) as ""a severe, often fatal illness in humans.
EVD outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 90%."" Symptoms include a
sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, a headache and a sore
throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, a rash, impaired kidney and
liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. The
infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and the
tissues of infected animals or people. The incubation period lasts from two to
21 days.

The virus was first registered in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the
Congo) in 1976, with outbreaks reported from Sudan, Gabon, the Republic of the
Congo, Angola, and Cote d’Ivoire. The latest Ebola epidemics in West Africa in
2014-2016 killed more than 11,300 people, with more than 28,600 contracting
the disease. The most lethal outcomes were reported in Guinea, Sierra Leone
and Liberia.

Russian doctors and scientists have played an important role in fighting
Ebola. In 2017, reports said that an Ebola vaccine had been developed by the
Novosibirsk-based VECTOR Research Center.

Founded in 1974, VECTOR is one of the world’s largest research centers.
Initially, it studied the causative agents of such deadly disease as anthrax
and tularemia to create biological weapons based on them. Currently, the
center develops tools for diagnosing and treating infectious diseases. Its
specialists, in particular, are developing vaccines against swine flu, HIV and
Ebola.

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the “Limitless” star got his first break in the entertainment business in 1998 when he got a part on the popular HBO drama “Sex in the City” alongside Sarah Jessica Parker. (RELATED: ‘American Sniper’ CRUSHES Box Office Records)

The exposure got him in the door and soon he would score a part in 2002 in “Changing Lanes” alongside such greats as Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Affleck.

But he is probably best known for his role in the insane buddy-comedy movie “The Hangover” in 2009 about a bunch of guys who get slipped drugs on their buddy’s bachelor party night and they have to rebuild the pieces of what happened to find the groom before the wedding. (RELATED: Irina Shayk Flashes A Whole New Kind Of Cleavage — The Underboob)

During development, cells seem to decode their fate through optimal information processing, which could hint at a more general principle of life.In 1891, when the German biologist Hans Driesch split two-cell sea urchin embryos in half, he found that each of the separated cells then gave rise to its own complete, albeit smaller, larva. Somehow, the halves ""knew"" to change their entire developmental program: At that stage, the blueprint for what they would become had apparently not yet been drawn out, at least not in ink.Since then, scientists have been trying to understand what goes into making this blueprint, and how instructive it is. (Driesch himself, frustrated at his inability to come up with a solution, threw up his hands and left the field entirely.) It's now known that some form of positional information makes genes variously switch on and off throughout the embryo, giving cells distinct identities based on their location. But the signals carrying that information seem to fluctuate wildly and chaotically - the opposite of what you might expect for an important guiding influence.""The [embryo] is a noisy environment,"" said Robert Brewster, a systems biologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. ""But somehow it comes together to give you a reproducible, crisp body plan.""The same precision and reproducibility emerge from a sea of noise again and again in a range of cellular processes. That mounting evidence is leading some biologists to a bold hypothesis:Questions about optimal decoding, according to Aleksandra Walczak, a biophysicist at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, ""are everywhere in biology.""Biologists haven't traditionally cast analyses of living systems as optimization problems because the complexity of those systems makes them hard to quantify, and because it can be difficult to discern what would be getting optimized. Moreover, while evolutionary theory suggests that evolving systems can improve over time, nothing guarantees that they should be driven to an optimal level.Yet when researchers have been able to appropriately determine what cells are doing, many have been surprised to see clear indications of optimization. Hints have turned up in how the brain responds to external stimuli and how microbes respond to chemicals in their environments. Now some of the best evidence has emerged from a new study of fly larva development, reported recently in Cell.For decades, scientists have been studying fruit fly larvae for clues about how development unfolds. Some details became apparent early on: A cascade of genetic signals establishes a pattern along the larva's head-to-tail axis. Signaling molecules called morphogens then diffuse through the embryonic tissues, eventually defining the formation of body parts.Particularly important in the fly are four ""gap"" genes, which are expressed separately in broad, overlapping domains along the axis. The proteins they make in turn help regulate the expression of ""pair-rule"" genes, which create an extremely precise, periodic striped pattern along the embryo. The stripes establish the groundwork for the later division of the body into segments.(Full study here: Development 2002 129:4399-4409) How cells make sense of these diffusion gradients has always been a mystery. The widespread assumption was that after being pointed in roughly the right direction (so to speak) by the protein levels, cells would continuously monitor their changing surroundings and make small corrective adjustments as development proceeded, locking in on their planned identity relatively late. That model harks back to the ""developmental landscape"" proposed by Conrad Waddington in 1956. He likened the process of a cell homing in on its fate to a ball rolling down a series of ever-steepening valleys and forked paths. Cells had to acquire more and more information to refine their positional knowledge over time - as if zeroing in on where and what they were through ""the 20 questions game,"" according to Jané Kondev, a physicist at Brandeis University.Such a system could be accident prone, however: Some cells would inevitably take the wrong paths and be unable to get back on track. In contrast, comparisons of fly embryos revealed that the placement of pair-rule stripes was incredibly precise, to within 1 percent of the embryo's length - that is, to single-cell accuracy.That prompted a group at Princeton University, led by the biophysicists Thomas Gregor and William Bialek, to suspect something else:And that's just what they found.Over the course of 12 years, they measured morphogen and gap-gene protein concentrations, cell by cell, from one embryo to the next, to determine how all four gap genes were most likely to be expressed at every position along the head-to-tail axis. From those probability distributions, they built a ""dictionary,"" or decoder - an explicit map that could spit out a probabilistic estimate of a cell's position based on its gap-gene protein concentration levels.Around five years ago, the researchers - including Mariela Petkova, who started the measurement work as an undergraduate at Princeton (and is currently pursuing a doctorate in biophysics at Harvard University), and Gašper Tkačik, now at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria - determined this mapping by assuming it worked like what's known as an optimal Bayesian decoder (that is, the decoder used Bayes' rule for inferring the likelihood of an event from prior conditional probabilities). The Bayesian framework allowed them to flip the ""unknowns,"" the conditions of probability: Their measurements of gap gene expression, given position, could be used to generate a ""best guess"" of position, given only gap gene expression.The team found that the fluctuations of the four gap genes could indeed be used to predict the locations of cells with single-cell precision. No less than maximal information about all four would do, however: When the activity of only two or three gap genes was provided, the decoder's location predictions were not nearly so accurate. Versions of the decoder that used less of the information from all four gap genes - that, for instance, responded only to whether each gene was on or off - made worse predictions, too.According to Walczak, ""No one has ever measured or shown how well reading out the concentration of these molecular gradients ... actually pinpoints a specific position along the axis.""Now they had: Even given the limited number of molecules and underlying noise of the system, the varying concentrations of the gap genes was sufficient to differentiate two neighboring cells in the head-to-tail axis - and the rest of the gene network seemed to be transmitting that information optimally.""But the question always remained open: Does the biology actually care?"" Gregor said. ""Or is this just something that we measure?"" Could the regulatory regions of DNA that responded to the gap genes really be wired up in such a way that they could decode the positional information those genes contained?The biophysicists teamed up with the Nobel Prize-winning biologist Eric Wieschaus to test whether the cells were actually making use of the information potentially at their disposal. They created mutant embryos by modifying the gradients of morphogens in the very young fly embryos, which in turn altered the expression patterns of the gap genes and ultimately caused pair-rule stripes to shift, disappear, get duplicated or have fuzzy edges. Even so, the researchers found that their decoder could predict the changes in mutated pair-rule expression with surprising accuracy. ""They show that the map is broken in mutants, but in a way that the decoder predicts,"" Walczak said.""You could imagine that if it was getting information from other sources, you couldn't trick [the cells] like that,"" Brewster added. ""Your decoder would fail.""These findings represent ""a signpost,"" according to Kondev, who was not involved with the study.""Through evolution, these cells have figured out how to implement Bayes' trick using regulatory DNA.""How the cells do it remains a mystery. Right now, ""the whole thing is kind of wonderful and magical,"" said John Reinitz, a systems biologist at the University of Chicago.Even so, the work provides a new way of thinking about early development, gene regulation and, perhaps, evolution in general.The findings provide a fresh perspective on Waddington's idea of a developmental landscape. According to Gregor, their work indicates that there's no need for 20 questions or a gradual refinement of knowledge after all. The landscape ""is steep from the beginning,"" he said. All the information is already there.""Natural selection [seems to be] pushing the system hard enough so that it ... reaches a point where the cells are performing at the limit of what physics allows,"" said Manuel Razo-Mejia, a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology.It's possible that the high performance in this case is a fluke: Since fruit fly embryos develop very quickly, perhaps in their case ""evolution has found this optimal solution because of that pressure to do everything very rapidly,"" said James Briscoe, a biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London who did not participate in this study. To really cement whether this is something more general, then, researchers will have to test the decoder in other species, including those that develop more slowly.Even so, these results set up intriguing new questions to ask about the often-enigmatic regulatory elements. Scientists don't have a solid grasp of how regulatory DNA codes for the control of other genes' activities. The team's findings suggest that this involves an optimal Bayesian decoder, which allows the regulatory elements to respond to very subtle changes in combined gap gene expression.Kondev said."" he added. ""That's a question we could not have asked before this study.""""That's really what this work sets up as the next challenge in the field,"" Briscoe said. Besides, there may be many ways of implementing such a decoder at the molecular level, meaning that this idea could apply to other systems as well. In fact, hints of it have been uncovered in the development of the neural tube in vertebrates, the precursor of their central nervous system - which would call for a very different underlying mechanism.Moreover, if these regulatory regions need to perform an optimal decoding function, that potentially limits how they can evolve - and in turn, how an entire organism can evolve. ""We have this one example ... which is the life that evolved on this planet,"" Kondev said, and because of that, the important constraints on what life can be are unknown. Finding that cells show Bayesian behavior could be a hint that processing information effectively may be ""a general principle that makes a bunch of atoms stuck together loosely behave like the thing that we think is life.""But right now, it is still only a hint. Although it would be ""kind of a physicist's dream,"" Gregor said, ""we are far from really having proof for this.""That goal later turned into a broader consideration of how to transmit information optimally through a channel. It wasn't much of a leap to apply this framework to the brain's sensory systems and how they measured, encoded and decoded inputs to produce a response.Now some experts are trying to think about all kinds of ""sensory systems"" in this way: Razo-Mejia, for instance, has studied how optimally bacteria sense and process chemicals in their environment, and how that might affect their fitness. Meanwhile, Walczak and her colleagues have been asking what a ""good decoding strategy"" might look like in the adaptive immune system, which has to recognize and respond to a massive repertoire of intruders.""I don't think optimization is an aesthetic or philosophical idea. It's a very concrete idea,"" Bialek said. ""Optimization principles have time and again pointed to interesting things to measure."" Whether or not they are correct, he considers them productive to think about.""Of course, the difficulty is that in many other systems, the property being decoded is more difficult than one-dimensional position [along the embryo's axis],"" Walczak said. ""The problem is harder to define.""That's what made the system Bialek and his colleagues studied so tantalizing. ""There aren't many examples in biology where a high-level idea, like information in this case, leads to a mathematical formula"" that is then testable in experiments on living cells, Kondev said.It's this marriage of theory and experiment that excites Bialek. He hopes to see the approach continue to guide work in other contexts. ""What's not clear,"" he said, ""is whether the observation [of optimization] is a curiosity that arises in a few corners, or whether there's something general about it.""If the latter does prove to be the case, ""then that's very striking,"" Briscoe said. ""The ability for evolution to find these really efficient ways of doing things would be an incredible finding.""Kondev agreed. ""As a physicist, you hope that the phenomenon of life is not just about the specific chemistry and DNA and molecules that make living things on planet Earth - that it's broader,"" he said. ""What is that broader thing? I don't know. But maybe this is lifting a little bit of the veil off that mystery.""Correction added on March 15: The text was updated to acknowledge the contributions of Mariela Petkova and Gašper Tkačik.",,https://www.sott.net/article/409354-The-statistical-mathematics-that-tells-a-cell-what-it-is,2019-03-18 15:48:08+00:00,1552938488,1567545864,science and technology,mathematics
